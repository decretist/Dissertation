### Zipf

Zipf's theories of language proceeded from wider assumptions: that
human language had evolved to take advantage the large but not
unlimited (considerable but finite) resources the human brain
dedicated to language processing and that the word distribution
(which Zipf saw as universal across all languages) was a necessary
adaptation to use those computational resources as efficiently as
possible.
