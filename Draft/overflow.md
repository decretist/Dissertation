The two-dimensional visualization above proceeded from the traditional
assumption that Gratian's *dicta*---defined as the hypothetical
case statements (*themata*) plus the first- and second-recension
*dicta* including the *dicta* from *de Pen*.---are the work of a
unitary author, the eponymous Gratian. The consequence of that
assumption for the purpose of experimental design (the design of
that demonstration) is that we can treat the corpus of texts analyzed
in that test/demonstration as the entire population of words
attributable to the author Gratian. Population standard deviation
was therefore the appropriate statistical technique to apply to
visualize word frequency variations among/between samples within
that population.

That does not mean that we cannot apply the established techniques
of authorship attribution to Gratian's *dicta*, but it does mean
that we have to make careful decisions about experimental design.
