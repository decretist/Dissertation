## Prologue

The purpose of the following short introduction is to indicate the
importance of Gratian's *Decretum,* and to contextualize the
composition of the *Decretum* within the broader twelfth-century
revolution in legal science.

* * *

The relevance of the *Decretum* extends to everyday contemporary
life. It is quite common for twenty-first century American Roman
Catholics to have had some experience with diocesan marriage tribunals
and the marriage annulment process (for example, my wife once had
to submit written testimony to a diocesan marriage tribunal in
support of her sister's petition to have her first marriage annulled).
When they come into contact with the marriage annulment process,
contemporaries become participants in a legal system that, at least
in its conceptual outlines, was first systematized by Gratian in
cases 27-36 in Part II of the *Decretum*, the so-called marriage
*causae*.

Modern scholars of Gratian's *Decretum* customarily offer *apologia*
for the object of their study, lauding Gratian as the "Father of
the Systematic Study of Canon Law", and citing the contemporary
relevance of the *Decretum* as the vital source, for example, of
the Roman Catholic canon law of marriage. The appeal to marriage
law is an effective one, because the workings of diocesan marriage
tribunals have touched, directly or indirectly, most Catholic
families in twenty-first century North America, and media therefore
cover controversies over Catholic marriage law as front-page news.

## School, Faculty, University

A number of your comments concern the rapid transition from school
to faculty to university in the twelfth century. Like the triple-point
temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous states
of matter are all present, the compilation of the first recension
of the *Decretum* sits at a triple-point moment at which aspects
of the school, faculty, and university are all present. The classroom
performance of the historical Gratian that I suggest was preserved
(memorialized?) by his students in the form of the first recension
of the *Decretum* was clearly a phenomenon of the schools. I'm
suggesting that the existence and availability of books like *Sic
et Non* and the *Decretum* made possible the transition away from
the school characterized by the personal, highly individualized,
teaching of a master learned and charismatic enough to gather a
critical mass of students. With the transition from school to
faculty, the basis for instruction was no longer (or at least not
exclusively) on individualized instruction or personal teaching
offered by a particularly gifted master. Instead instruction was
based on a widely-available, soon to be standardized, textbook, or
an abbreviation of one.

The transition from faculty to university, I think, has been obscured
by retrospective myth-making in which famous universities, once
established, project their origins as far into the past as possible
in order to enhance the lustre of their names.
