## Prologue

The purpose of the following short introduction is to indicate the
importance of Gratian's *Decretum,* and to contextualize the
composition of the *Decretum* within the broader twelfth-century
revolution in legal science.

* * *

The relevance of the *Decretum* extends to everyday contemporary
life. It is quite common for twenty-first century American Roman
Catholics to have had some experience with diocesan marriage tribunals
and the marriage annulment process (for example, my wife once had
to submit written testimony to a diocesan marriage tribunal in
support of her sister's petition to have her first marriage annulled).
When they come into contact with the marriage annulment process,
contemporaries become participants in a legal system that, at least
in its conceptual outlines, was first systematized by Gratian in
cases 27-36 in Part II of the *Decretum*, the so-called marriage
*causae*.

Modern scholars of Gratian's *Decretum* customarily offer *apologia*
for the object of their study, lauding Gratian as the "Father of
the Systematic Study of Canon Law", and citing the contemporary
relevance of the *Decretum* as the vital source, for example, of
the Roman Catholic canon law of marriage. The appeal to marriage
law is an effective one, because the workings of diocesan marriage
tribunals have touched, directly or indirectly, most Catholic
families in twenty-first century North America, and media therefore
cover controversies over Catholic marriage law as front-page news.
