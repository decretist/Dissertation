It appears unlikely that the author of the case statements or
_themata_ is the same person as the author or authors of the
first-recension _dicta_ in the aggregate.

Modern scholars of Gratian's _Decretum_ customarily offer _apologia_
for the object of their study, lauding Gratian as the "Father of
the Systematic Study of Canon Law", and citing the contemporary
relevance of the _Decretum_ as the vital source, for example, of
the Roman Catholic canon law of marriage. The appeal to marriage
law is an effective one, because the workings of dicesan marriage
tribunals have touched, directly or indirectly, most Catholic
families in twenty-first century North America, and media therefore
cover controversies over Catholic marriage law as front-page news.

By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the systematic study
of canon law had evolved in a direction of which its father Gratian
would probably not have approved, and which he may even have had
difficulty recognizing as the same practical or applied branch of
theology his own work presupposed it to be. After around 1190, the
attention of both academic and practicing canonists decisively
turned away from theological jurisprudence in the tradition of
Gratian, based on a rich collection of scriptural, patristic,
conciliar, and papal source texts, and towards a much more narrowly
circumscribed technical jurisprudence focused exclusively on
contemporary papal decretals.
