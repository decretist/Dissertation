Both the content and the form of the *Decretum* had an enormous
impact on the civilization of Medieval Europe. Gratian's methodological
breakthrough transformed the study of canon law into a rigorous
academic discipline. His imposition of a consistent interpretive
framework (hermeneutic) on the inherited and internally contradictory
mass of canonical texts transformed them into a cohesive system of
law. A generation before Gratian, Ivo of Chartres (â€ .1115) had
proposed the possibility of such a program in the preface to his
own canonical collections, but had left its application as an
exercise to his readers. Gratian demonstrated that Ivo's program
could in fact be carried out in a truly systematic way, and did so
at an historical moment when the need for such a sweeping synthesis
was particularly compelling. Gratian was working in immediate
aftermath of the Concordat of Worms (1122) that recognized the
formal juridical independence of the Church from secular authority.
Gratian's *Decretum* provided the comprehensive blueprint for a
legal machinery to govern every aspect of an explicitly and pervasively
Christian society.

The form in which Gratian's intellectual achievement was transmitted
had as great an impact as its content. The *Decretum* was arguably
the first book in the European tradition written from the ground
up as a textbook. Gratian's own teaching was probably typical of
the relatively informal and unstructured environment of the Medieval
schools, characterized by the focus on a particularly gifted master,
learned and charismatic enough to gather a critical mass of students.
The existence of a textbook, however, made it possible for someone
other than the original master to teach the same, or a similar,
course. A textbook that circulates widely enough becomes a *de
facto* standard, and classes taught from it, by whomever, become
likewise standardized. The *Decretum*, and classes taught from it
or its abbreviations, attained the status of *de facto* standards
across much of Europe very quickly---within two decades. **I believe
that new evidence previewed in the introduction above suggests that
we owe the content of the *Decretum* to Gratian, but its form to
his students.**

The *Decretum* was a product of the schools, but became the outstanding
textbook of the brief age of the independent faculties of canon
law. Faculties came into being as an institutional response to a
new problem raised by standardized classes taught around standardized
textbooks: what are the requisite qualifications for those to be
admitted to the study and teaching of canon law? The distinctive
innovation of the faculty was the conferring of degrees on students
who completed a prescribed sequence of standardized courses, defined
in such a way that the standard of completion for students more or
less coincided with that of admission to teaching. The faculty was
a crucial intermediate stage in the institutional evolution from
school to university, one that has been obscured by the retrospective
myth-making of famous universities, which, once established, sought
to enhance the lustre of their names by projecting their origins
as far as possible into the past. If it is going too far to claim
that the *Decretum* was the textbook that created the university,
it is not going too far to recognize that its existence was a
necessary precondition for the emergence of the faculty.

The end of the age of the independent faculty coincided with the
closing of one chapter in the long career of Gratian's *Decretum*.
By the time the fully-corporatized university subsumed the faculties
in the first decades of the thirteenth century, the "old law" of
Gratian had been displaced as the focus of intellectual activity
and source of research problems by the "new law" of papal decretals,
and the *Decretum* was relegated to a secondary place in the academic
study of canon law. It was still the basis for the indispensable
first course, and would remain so until 1917, but no longer held
the intellectual attention of the discipline.
