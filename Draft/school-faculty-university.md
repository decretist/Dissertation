Both the content and the form of the *Decretum* had an enormous
impact on the civilization of Medieval Europe. Gratian's methodological
breakthrough transformed the study of canon law into a rigorous
academic discipline. His imposition of a consistent interpretive
framework (hermeneutic) on the inherited and internally contradictory
mass of canonical texts transformed them into a coherent system of
law. A generation before Gratian, Ivo of Chartres (â€ .1115) had
proposed the possibility of such a program in the preface to his
own canonical collections but had left its application to his
readers. Gratian demonstrated that Ivo's program could in fact be
carried out in a truly systematic way and did so at an historical
moment when the need for such a sweeping synthesis was particularly
compelling. Gratian was working in the immediate aftermath of the
Concordat of Worms (1122) that recognized the formal juridical
independence of the Church from secular authority. Gratian's
*Decretum* provided a comprehensive blueprint for the legal machinery
by which the Church ultimately came to govern the many aspects of
life in a pervasively Christian society over which it claimed
exclusive jurisdiction.

The form in which Gratian's intellectual achievement was transmitted
had as great an impact as its content. The *Decretum* was arguably
the first book in the European tradition written from the ground
up as a textbook. Gratian's own teaching was probably typical of
the relatively informal and unstructured environment of the medieval
schools, organized around the activity of a gifted master, learned
and charismatic enough to gather a critical mass of students. The
existence of a textbook, however, made it possible for someone other
than the original master to teach the same, or a similar, course.
A textbook that circulates widely enough becomes a *de facto*
standard, and classes taught from it, by whomever, become likewise
standardized. The *Decretum*, and classes taught from it or its
abbreviations, attained the status of *de facto* standards across
much of Europe very quickly---within two decades. **I believe that
new evidence previewed in the introduction above suggests that we
owe the content of the *Decretum* to Gratian, but its form to his
students.**

The *Decretum* was a product of the schools, but became the outstanding
textbook of the brief age of the faculties of canon law. Faculties
came into being as an institutional response to a new problem raised
by standardized classes taught around standardized textbooks: what
are the requisite qualifications for the teaching and practice of
canon law? The distinctive innovation of the faculty was the
conferring of degrees on students who completed a prescribed sequence
of standardized courses, defined in such a way that the standard
of completion for students more or less coincided with that of
admission to teaching. The faculty was a crucial intermediate stage
in the institutional evolution from school to university, one that
has been obscured by the retrospective myth-making of famous
universities, which, once established, sought to enhance the lustre
of their names by projecting their origins as far as possible into
the past. It is perhaps going too far to claim that the *Decretum*
was the textbook that created the university. It is not, however,
going too far to recognize that its existence was a necessary
precondition for the emergence of the faculty of canon law, just
as the existence of Peter Lombard's *Sentences* was a necessary
precondition for the emergence after 1160 of the faculty of
theology.[^1]

In the first decades of the 13th century, both the faculty and the
*Decretum* were relegated to more modest places in the academic
world than they had occupied in the latter half of the 12th century,
as the corporate university subsumed the faculties, and the focus
of legal scholarship in canon law gradually shifted from the "old
law" of Gratian to the "new law" of papal decretals. Modern complaints
about the corporatization of the university notwithstanding,
*universitas* means corporation. We tend to think of a corporation
as a commercial entity, but medieval legal thinkers looked upon the
corporation at a more foundational level, as a means for legally
creating an artificial person, and then investing that "person"
with rights and privileges that could otherwise only be held by a
natural person or persons, such as the right to own property, or
in the case of a cathedral chapter, the right to elect a bishop.
Faculties aspired to permanence, unlike schools, which rarely
survived the departure or death of their masters, and incorporation
provided universities with a form of organization well-adapted for
achieving that aspiration through the accumulation of legal rights
and privileges. The right of a university to own property is obviously
useful and even ultimately necessary, but the right that is most
fundamental for a university is the right to determine qualifications
for teaching.

Attention devoted to the *Decretum* after around 1190 tended to
focus on improving its utility as a teaching text. Johannes Teutonicus
(c.1170-1245) compiled more than a half century's worth of accumulated
gloss commentary on Gratian into the *Glossa Ordinaria* around 1215,
and Bartholomeus Brixiensis (fl.1234-1258) revised the ordinary
gloss around 1245. The *Decretum* remained the basis for the
indispensable first course in canon law throughout the Middle Ages,
and indeed would continue to do so until 1917, but it never again
held the intellectual attention of the discipline the way it had
in the second half of the twelfth century.

you an argument about the priority of medicine or law. (Stan Chodorow)
