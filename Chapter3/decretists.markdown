### Gratian's teaching career

Evidence concerning Gratian's career as a teacher of canon law is
contradictory. Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum* have
seen it as a teaching text, both in the sense that its intended use (or
at least one of its intended uses) was as an introductory textbook, and
also in the sense that it reflected the author's experience as a
classroom teacher. On the one hand, the early manuscript tradition for
the *Decretum* displays enough variation, even among the first-recension
manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P, to suggest that the text developed
continuously over the span of, and in parallel with, a relatively long
teaching career---perhaps a decade or more. On the other hand, Gratian's
personal obscurity is so profound---Stephan Kuttner compared Gratian to
the anonymous builders of Gothic cathedrals[1]---as to suggest a short,
or even no, teaching career.[2]

Considering the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the author
of the foundational textbook for the study of canon law in the classical
period, one of the truly stellar intellectual achievements of the
renaissance of the twelfth century, his complete absence from the kinds
of academic genealogies and origin stories that Odofredus (†1265) handed
down to his own Roman law students is striking indeed.[3]

We might be better able to assess Gratian's teaching career and how it
influenced the compilation and transmission of the *Decretum* were we in
a position to positively identify at least a few of his students. Here
again, however, the evidence is mixed at best. Three twelfth-century
canonist have, with varying degrees of plausibility, been identified as
having been students of Gratian: Paucapalea (fl. 1140s), Simon of
Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179), Omnebene (d. 1185).

#### Paucapalea

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early period of
the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's immediate
footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was "\[a\] pupil of
Gratian and the author of the first commentary on the *Decretum*".[4]
But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea does not refer to
Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis ipsa decreta sunt
materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are the subject matter of the
master producing this work."[5]

The omission is significant. Prefaces to academic books in the twelfth
century formed a recognized genre with well-established conventions. In
an age resistant to any attempt by the human present to appropriate the
authority of the divinely-inspired past, a commentator like Paucapalea
was expected to offer an explicit statement in his preface affirming the
authority of both the work commented on and its author. If Paucapalea
had had something to say about the authority and authorship of Gratian,
his readers would have expected him to do so in his preface. That he did
not suggests that he did not known enough about Gratian to credibly do
so.[6]

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows both
that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work: "*In
extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine domini atque
baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat, et in his suum
tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the dedication of
churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism, and also
confirmation, and with these things concludes his treatise."[7]

If Rambaud is correct that *de Consecratione* was not part of the
original *Decretum*, the fact that Paucapalea attributed it to the same
unnamed master responsible for rest of the text on which he was
commenting strongly suggests that he did not have direct knowledge of
Gratian or his plan of work.

#### Omnibonus or Omnebene

Omnibonus or Omnebene (d.1185) composed an adaptation or transformation
of the *Decretum* in the 1150s.[8] The basis for the claim that Omnebene
was a student of Gratian is an entry for the year 1130 in the chronicle
of Norman monk Robert of Torigni (†1186)

> *Gratianus episcopus Clusinus coadunavit decreta valde utilia ex
> decretis, canonibus, doctoribus, legibus Romanis, sufficientia ad
> omnes ecclesiasticas causas decidendas, que frequentantur in curia
> Romana et in aliis curiis ecclesiasticis. Hec postmodum abbreviavit
> magister Omnebonum episcopus Veronensis, qui fuerat eius discipulus.*
> (Gratian bishop of Chiusi brought together very useful decrees out of
> decrees, canons, doctors, Roman laws, sufficient for deciding all
> ecclesiastical cases, which are resorted to at the Roman curia and in
> other ecclesiastical courts. Master Omnebonum bishop of Verona, who
> had been his student, afterwards abbreviated them.)[9]

Although the evidence of Robert's chronicle is by Noonan's standard
hearsay, Robert's reputation as a well-informed source concerning
Gratian has improved in recent years since the Siena necrology has made
the identification of Gratian as bishop of Chiusi more probable.

The dates do not preclude Omnebene's having been a student of Gratian.
Although Omnebene lived into the 1180s, the adaptation itself seems to
date from around 1156, perhaps a decade and a half after the end of
whatever teaching career Gratian may have had, and at precisely the
moment that continent-wide interest in the text was increasing most
rapidly.[10]

#### Simon of Bisignano

Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179) was the author of a *Summa
decretorum* dated c.1177-79, and a number of glosses on the *Decretum*
are attributed to him.[11] The evidence that Simon of Bisignano was a
student of Gratian’s comes from references within his writings.[12]
Simon refers to himself as *discipulus* and to Gratian as *magister* in
at least two places in his *Summa* (**Landau says "frequently"**). There
is, however a hiatus of almost four decades between the latest plausible
date for the end of Gratian's teaching career, and the documentary
evidence we have for Simon's professional career as a canonist. Although
it is not chronologically impossible for Simon to have been Gratian's
student, it seems more likely that he described himself as *discipulus*
in something like the same sense that we might describe contemporary
scholars like Chodorow, Pennington, and Winroth as "students of
Gratian".

### Epilogue

By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the systematic study of
canon law had evolved in a direction of which its father Gratian would
probably not have approved, and which he may even have had difficulty
recognizing as the same practical or applied branch of theology his own
work presupposed it to be. After around 1190, the attention of both
academic and practicing canonists decisively turned away from
theological jurisprudence in the tradition of Gratian, based on a rich
collection of scriptural, patristic, conciliar, and papal source texts,
and towards a much more narrowly circumscribed technical jurisprudence
focused exclusively on contemporary papal decretals.

[1] "He is one of those deeply admirable men of pious modesty, like the
builders of the medieval cathedrals, whose person is hidden and effaced
completely behind their immortal works." (Stephan Kuttner, “The Father
of the Science of Canon Law,” *Jurist* 1 (1941): 4).

[2] **Winroth argues for a short teaching career, Southern argues for no
teaching career.** Southern also asserts that no one claims to have been
Gratian's student---"none of the earliest users of his work claims to
have been taught by him". "although other scholars made some very early
alterations and additions to the text of the *Decretum*, none of them
claimed to have been taught by him." (R. W. Southern, *Scholastic
Humanism and the Unification of Europe*, vol. 1 (Oxford, UK ; Cambridge,
Mass., USA: Blackwell, 1995), 287, 304). **Does Southern provide
footnotes to support these statements?**

[3] **Expand:** The tradition of Roman law teaching in Bologna preserved
an elaborate genealogy of masters and their students: Pepo preceded
Wernerius \[Irnerius\], who taught the Four Doctors. Odofredus is an
important source for this tradition, and his remarks about Irnerius can
be found in his commentary on *Dig.* 1.1.6. Odofredus, *Lectura super
Digesto veteri*, (2 volumes, Lyon: 1550-1552; repr. Bologna 1967-1968).

Odofredus is also the source for associating Gratian with the monastery
of Saints Felix and Nabor. (John T. Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here: The

<CAVSA XXVII> &lt;Q.II&gt; § *Sequitur secunda questio* Sacram et
authenticam pie recordationis Gratianus de matrimonio distinctionem
composuit, quam quidam inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem et
simplicium potibus inuidentes more seuorum animalium aquas limpidas
turbauerunt. Gratianus uero, canonum habita notitia et mente perspecta,
dixit inter sponsum et sponsam esse matrimonium, sed initiatum; inter
uirum et uxorem consummatum. Sed quoniam non est discipulus super
magistrum nec debet securis contra eum qui secat gloriari timemus os
nostrum in celum mittere et eum reprehendere cuius non sumus digni
soluere corrigiam calceamenti.

Note that the phrase "sed inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem" also
occurs in Rufinus's treatment of the same question, C.27 q.2. (Rufinus,
*Summa Decretorum*, ed. Heinrich Singer (Aalen : Paderborn: Scientia
Verlag ; F. Schöningh, 1963), 440).

Gratian of pious remembrance composed a sacred and *authenticam*
distinction concerning marriage, *quam quidam inanis glorie aucupes
fecere bifrontem* and not seeing with the drinks of the simple, \[they\]
troubled clear waters in the manner of *seuorum* animals. But Gratian
*habita notitia* of the canon and *mente perspecta*, said that matrimony
is between spouse and spouse, but having been consecrated (*initiatum*),
is consummated between husband and wife. But since the disciple is not
above his master (Matthew 10:24, Luke 6:40), and the axe (*securis*)
ought not boast (*gloriari*) against him who cuts (*secat*) (Isaiah
10:15), we fear to send our mouth into heaven (Psalm 72:9?) and to find
fault with him the string (*corrigiam*) of whose shoes we are not worthy
to loosen (John 1:27) (PLE).

<DISTINCTIO IIII> 31. *Solet queri* Quod quamuis Magister noster
docuerit, nos tamen in hoc nolumus eum imitari.

Although our master taught that, we nevertheless do not wish to imitate
him in this (PLE).
