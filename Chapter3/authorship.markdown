## Authority

Modern scholars considering the authorship of a text are primarily
interested in the question of who wrote the exact words it contains and
whose thought is reflected in the arguments it makes. This dissertation
is about whether one, two, or many authors wrote the exact words in the
text of the *dicta* in the *Decretum*. The medieval sources we depend on
for much of our evidence about who wrote the *Decretum* were not
uninterested in the question of who wrote the exact words in the text,
but that question overlapped for them in a way that it does not for us
with the question of who was the source of the text's authority. The
question of the authority of the *Decretum* therefore has to be
considered separately from that of authorship.

In the middle ages, to presume to take on the role of *auctor* was to
make a claim (at least implicitly) to *auctoritas*. Medieval writers
were in general quite reticent about making claims to authority on their
own behalf, and employed a variety of techniques to maintain plausible
deniability that they were in fact claiming authorship and the authority
that went with it. Some repudiated the role of author altogether and
circulated the texts they wrote pseudonymously under the name of a
canonical author of unquestioned authority. Augustine was the
overwhelming favorite, and Gratian extensively quoted in his *de
Penitentia* from a text, *De vera et falsa penitentia*, that circulated
under such false pretences. Others sought to distance themselves from
the role of author by locating authority in texts they quoted rather
than in the original use they made of those quoted texts in their own
writing.[1] In any event, the modern notion that the ultimate source for
the authority of a text is is an independent judgement by the reader of
the validity of the arguments it contains is simply not applicable to
the twelfth century.

The problem of authorship and authority was particularly acute in the
first half of the twelfth century, because early scholastic readers were
more alert to the chinks in the armor of traditional authorities than
their less-sophisticated predecessors had been. Peter Abelard was unique
in the radicalism of his solution to the problem: in *Sic et non*, he
subverted and indeed dissolved the entire notion of authority by showing
that texts written by equally authoritative authors were in actual, not
just apparent, disagreement.

Gratian undertook the conservative hermeneutical project of harmonizing
the apparently discordant canons to the level of sophistication demanded
by a twelfth-century scholastic audience, and accordingly adopted the
strategy of locating authority in the texts that he quoted. It seems,
however, that the widespread reception of the *Decretum* as itself
authoritative benefited from an accidental feature of the text. The page
layout of early manuscripts of the *Decretum*---the placement of
Gratian's *dicta* inline with the authorities rather on the
margins---had the unintentional effect of promoting Gratian himself to
the status of an authority (or at least to a status of near-equality
with his authorities). Even though the specific page layout was probably
adopted in the 1130s or 1140s for no particular reason other than that
the conventions for the various genres of the literature of canon law
had not yet been firmly established, readers in the 1150s and 1160s seem
to have understood it, at least implicitly, as a claim to authority, a
claim that they were more than willing to accept.[2] This was almost
certainly an over-reading of the authority claim actually being made in
the *Decretum*.[3]

## Authorship

Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around the
figure of the author.[4] Three examples from classical and late
antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which this requirement could
be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary ambitions with the support
of highly skilled but unfree labor purchased out of his personal wealth,
most famously his slave and later freedman Tiro. A wealthy lay patron
named Ambrose paid for the secretarial staff that supported the
authorial activities of Origen of Alexandria (†253).[5] Quasi-monastic
members of the episcopal household of Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided
the scribal support that made his prodigious authorial output possible.
The mode of production pioneered by Augustine and his household in which
monastic labor enabled the creation of original texts by their authors
as well as the subsequent copying and circulation of finished texts
proved a durable one, and predominated in the Latin West until the
thirteenth century.[6]

Given the material and social technologies for authorship available in
the twelfth century, creation of a text the size of Gratian's *Decretum*
would necessarily have been a collaborative effort. Pennington has noted
that "Gratian may have had an atelier of assistants,"[7] but that
observation suggests that the nature of the collaboration between
Gratian and those Pennington conceives of as his assistant needs to be
examined more closely. What substantive intellectual contributions, if
any, did Gratian's collaborators make to the project?[8] There are a
number of indications, discussed in the previous chapter, that the
*Decretum* outgrew the ability of a single author to effectively manage
the development of the text. The question is whether Gratian's partial
loss of control of the project opened up a space for genuinely
collaborative authorship. The starting point for this inquiry is a
theoretically informed understanding of what authorship is.

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Grebner, Winroth, and
Pennington[9] reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes that if
we can identify the historical Gratian, we will have identified the
author of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of the first
recension), with authorship of the text understood in a way not unlike
the way in which we might understand the authorship of a modern literary
text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept of authorship, allowing
for the possibility that there might have been multiple authors.) In
conducting this kind of "quest of the historical Gratian," historians
have uncritically accepted a conceptualization of authorship that is
somewhat anachronistic when applied to a medieval text and has been
largely discarded by literary scholarship over the last half-century.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death of the Author" and Michel
Foucault's 1969 response "What Is an Author?" are foundational readings
in the theory of authorship.[10]

### Barthes

"The Death of the Author" holds a place in literary studies somewhat
similar to the place that Noonan's "Gratian Slept Here" holds in canon
law studies---it is a clearing of the ground of older ways of thinking
in the field. Although the title of the essay was a lightning-rod in
1980s theory war polemics, taken as if Barthes were arguing that texts
somehow wrote themselves, Medievalists will recognize the French title
of the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*.
Barthes's essay is short and relatively free of arcane technical terms.
Barthes was a literary critic and scholar making an argument to other
literary critics and scholars against the practice of close-reading
literary texts with the focus on the biographical and historical context
of the author and its relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the term "Author" to indicate the conceptualization of
authorship he is arguing against and the term "author" where he intends
to use the word in its more general and non-technical sense. An Author
is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a literary text, and
"is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his
child."[11] Barthes argues that authors cannot be Authors---no person or
persons can have a parent-child relationship to a text since all
literary texts are socially constructed: "The text is a tissue of
quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture."[12]

**Gratian may be the author of the *dicta* but he is not their Author.
The *dicta* are socially constructed "tissue\[s\] of quotations drawn
from the innumerable centres of culture."**

The Barthes's central argument is against precisely the kind of reading
that is prevalent in scholarship on Gratian and the *Decretum*:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish
> it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a conception
> suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting itself the
> important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases: society,
> history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author has been
> found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.[13]

Barthes uses the term "scriptor" to indicate an alternative
conceptualization of authorship in which the performative aspect of the
author's act is the central focus. Barthes uses the terms "criticism"
and "critic" to refer respectively to the activity of close-reading a
literary text and one engaging in that activity. Translating the terms
as "reading" and "reader" would not be seriously misleading. Gratian as
author of the *dicta* is therefore, using Barthes's definitions, both
scriptor and critic. The *dicta* were originally delivered in a
classroom setting, and thus have both a performative and a
contemporaneous aspect ("there is no other time than that of the
enunciation and every text is eternally written *here* and *now*")[14]
The *dicta* are also the record of a particular close-reading of a
selection of authoritative texts.

### Foucault

Barthes's criticism of the idea of authorship is apophatic, concerned
mostly with what, in his view, authorship is not. Barthes warns against
the conceptualization of authorship, centered on the
biographical-historical context of the individual author, that most
historians (including those who have written about Gratian's authorship
of the *Decretum*) take for granted. In place of the conceptualization
of authorship rendered suspect by Barthes, Foucault proposes the idea of
the "author function." He starts by asking "\[w\]hat is an author’s
name? How does it function?"[15] and then goes on to observe:

> ... if we proved that Shakespeare did not write those sonnets which
> pass for his, that would constitute a significant change and affect
> the manner in which the author's name functions. If we proved that
> Shakespeare wrote Bacon's *Organon* by showing that the same author
> wrote both the works of Bacon and those of Shakespeare, that would ...
> entirely modify the functioning of the author's name.[16]

Foucault has a reputation for using esoteric vocabulary in his
writing---his critics would say jargon---in a way that many historians
find objectionable. The technical use of the term "author function" is a
case in point. The idea that he is attempting to convey, however, is
relatively straightforward. Abstract away the biographical details about
the author from the work that the *idea* of the author does for us when
we read a text, and what remains is the author function. Ironically,
given the rather avant-garde reputation that is still attached to his
name at least in the English-speaking world, Foucault derives the
substantive content of the idea of the author function almost entirely
from Jerome (†420).

> In *De Viris illustribus*, Saint Jerome explains that homonymy is not
> sufficient to identify legitimately authors of more than one work ...
> The name as an individual trademark is not enough when one works
> within a textual tradition.[17]

> How, then can one attribute several discourses to one and the same
> author? How can one use the author function to determine if one is
> dealing with one or several individuals? Saint Jerome proposes four
> criteria:[18]

> \(1\) if among several books attributed to an author one is inferior
> to the others, it must be withdrawn from the list of the author’s
> works (the author is therefore defined as a constant level of value);

> \(2\) the same should be done if certain texts contradict the doctrine
> expounded in the author’s other works (the author is thus defined as a
> field of conceptual or theoretical coherence);

> \(3\) one must also exclude works that are written in a different
> style, containing words and expressions not ordinarily found in the
> writer’s production;

> \(4\) finally, passages quoting statements made or mentioning events
> that occurred after the author’s death must be regarded as
> interpolated texts (the author is seen as a historical figure at the
> crossroads of a certain number of events).[19]

Foucault's essay is a response to Barthes's.

Foucault's essay is more directly relevant than Barthes's to the
problems of authorship raised by Gratian's *Decretum*,

(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 191.

[2] "In the first recension, Gratian I both collected authoritative
texts and commented upon them, as did Peter Lombard in his roughly
contemporary *Sentences*. Both texts were written to meet the need for a
basic text-book in the teaching of their respective disciplines. Other
fields, such as Roman law, medicine, and biblical studies, already
possessed authoritative texts which could serve as the basis for the
teacher's commentary and interpretation. Gratian I and the Lombard were
in effect forced to create their own authoritative texts (their
authority deriving from the fact that they consisted mainly of
quotations) to be able effectively to teach their subjects. When they
did this, they had no reason to separate text from commentary. They
could not have suspected that their texts would become standard
school-texts, nor did they know that it later would become common to
keep text and commentary separate. Could they ever have guessed how
great the growth of their subjects would be after their deaths? In their
works, we can observe teachers creating tools for their own teaching
when there were as yet no standard forms for academic texts in their
subjects. The development of glosses, *summae*, *questiones*,
*distinctiones*, etc., came later, as did the awareness of teachers like
Bernard of Pavia that their compilations might become standard
school-texts (and, hence, that comments were best relegated to the
margins)." Winroth, , 191.

[3] At most, there seems to have been a limited claim of authority being
made by the authors of the first-recension *dicta* (Gratian 1) on behalf
of their *magister*, the author of the case statements (Gratian 0),
whose harmonization of the canons was authoritative for them.

[4] James Joseph O’Donnell, *Augustine: A New Biography*, 1st ed. (New

them.

possibilities. Those who have read the *Vita Augustini* written by
Possidius of Calama († c.437) are likely to be unimpressed by the
intellectual caliber of Augustine's episcopal household, and to assess
its contribution to his work accordingly.

derived the four criteria for determining whether a given "discursive

provides, however, no citations. Walzer and Inabinit indicate that
"similar principles" can be found in Karl Kelchner Hulley, “Principles

section of Hulley's article on "various points pertinent to questions of
authorship" is in fact almost certainly the ultimate source for
Foucault's four criteria, and provides citations to many works by Jerome
(not just *De Viris illustribus*) relevant to the question of
determining the authorship of a text or texts.
