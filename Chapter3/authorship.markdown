Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around the
figure of the author.[1] Three examples from classical and late
antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which this requirement could
be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary ambitions with the support
of highly skilled but unfree labor purchased out of his personal wealth,
most famously his slave and later freedman Tiro. A wealthy lay patron
named Ambrose paid for the secretarial staff that supported the
authorial activities of Origen of Alexandria (†253).[2] Quasi-monastic
members of the episcopal household of Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided
the scribal support that made his prodigious authorial output possible.
The mode of production pioneered by Augustine and his household in which
monastic labor enabled the creation of original texts by their authors
as well as the subsequent copying and circulation of finished texts
proved a durable one, and predominated in the Latin West until the
thirteenth century.[3]

Given the material and social technologies for authorship available in
the twelfth century, creation of a text the size of Gratian's *Decretum*
would necessarily have been a collaborative effort. Pennington has noted
that "Gratian may have had an atelier of assistants",[4] but that
observation suggests that the nature of the collaboration between
Gratian and those Pennington conceives of as his assistant needs to be
examined more closely. What substantive intellectual contributions, if
any, did Gratian's collaborators make to the project?[5] There are a
number of indications, discussed in the previous chapter, that the
*Decretum* outgrew the ability of a single author to effectively manage
the development of the text. The question is whether Gratian's partial
loss of control of the project opened up a space for collaborative
authorship. The starting point for this inquiry is a theoretically
informed understanding of what authorship is.

## Authorship

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Grebner, Winroth, and
Pennington[6] reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes that if
we can identify the historical Gratian, we will have identified the
author of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of the first
recension), with authorship of the text understood in a way not unlike
the way in which we might understand the authorship of a modern literary
text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept of authorship, allowing
for the possibility that there might have been multiple authors.) In
conducting this kind of "quest of the historical Gratian," historians
have uncritically accepted a conceptualization of authorship that is
somewhat anachronistic when applied to a medieval text and has been
largely discarded by literary scholarship over the last half-century.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death of the Author" and Michel
Foucault's 1969 response "What Is an Author?" are foundational readings
in the theory of authorship.[7]

### Barthes

"The Death of the Author" holds a place in literary studies somewhat
similar to the place that Noonan's "Gratian Slept Here" holds in canon
law studies---it is a clearing of the ground of older ways of thinking
in the field. Although the title of the essay was a lightning-rod in
1980s theory war polemics, taken as if Barthes were arguing that texts
somehow wrote themselves, Medievalists will recognize the French title
of the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*.
Barthes's essay is short and relatively free of arcane technical terms.
Barthes was a literary critic and scholar making an argument to other
literary critics and scholars against the practice of close-reading
literary texts with the focus on the biographical and historical context
of the author and its relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the term "Author" to indicate the conceptualization of
authorship he is arguing against and the term "author" where he intends
to use the word in its more general and non-technical sense. An Author
is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a literary text, and
"is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his
child."[8] Barthes argues that authors cannot be Authors---no person or
persons can have a parent-child relationship to a text since all
literary texts are socially constructed: "The text is a tissue of
quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture."[9]

**Gratian may be the author of the *dicta* but he is not their Author.
The *dicta* are socially constructed "tissue\[s\] of quotations drawn
from the innumerable centres of culture."**

The Barthes's central argument is against precisely the kind of reading
that is prevalent in scholarship on Gratian and the *Decretum*:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish
> it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a conception
> suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting itself the
> important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases: society,
> history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author has been
> found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.[10]

Barthes uses the term "scriptor" to indicate an alternative
conceptualization of authorship in which the performative aspect of the
author's act is the central focus. Barthes uses the terms "criticism"
and "critic" to refer respectively to the activity of close-reading a
literary text and one engaging in that activity. Translating the terms
as "reading" and "reader" would not be seriously misleading. Gratian as
author of the *dicta* is therefore, using Barthes's definitions, both
scriptor and critic. The *dicta* were originally delivered in a
classroom setting, and thus have both a performative and a
contemporaneous aspect ("there is no other time than that of the
enunciation and every text is eternally written *here* and *now*")[11]
The *dicta* are also the record of a particular close-reading of a
selection of authoritative texts.

### Foucault

Foucault's essay is a response to Barthes's.

Foucault's essay is more directly relevant than Barthes's to the
problems of authorship raised by Gratian's *Decretum*,
