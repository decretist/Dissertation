### Introduction

Post-Noonan scholarship on the biography of Gratian by Grebner,
Winroth, and Pennington[^1] has been conducted in the spirit of an
Albert Schweitzer-like "quest of the historical Gratian." **It is
worth noting that Noonan himself entertains a more nuanced concept
of authorship than Grebner, Winroth, and Pennington.** The unifying
idea has been that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we
will have identified the author of the *Decretum*, with the authorship
of the *Decretum* understood in a way very similar to the way in
which we might understand the authorship of a nineteenth century
novel. In doing so, these historians have uncritically accepted a
conceptualization of authorship that is anachronistic when applied
to medieval texts and has been discarded by literary scholarship
over the last half-century.

### Authorship vs. Authority

When modern scholars talk about authorship, they are mostly interested
in the question of who wrote the exact words in a text, and at a
higher level, who provided the structure of the argument it contains.
My dissertation is about whether one, two, or many authors wrote
the exact words in the text of the *dicta* in the *Decretum*. The
stylometric techniques I used do not extend to the structure of the
arguments the *dicta* contain. The medieval sources we depend on for
most of the evidence about who wrote the *Decretum* were not uninterested
in the question of who wrote the exact words of the text, but that
question overlapped for them in a way that it does not for us with
the question of who the source of the text’s authority was. The
questions of the authorship and authority of the *Decretum* therefore
have to be considered distinctly although not separately from one
another.

### *Decretum* vs. *dicta*

Furthermore, the *Decretum* is mostly quoted text. Therefore, the
questions of the authorship and authority of the *Decretum* as a whole
and of the *dicta* have to be considered distinctly although not
separately from one another.

### Was Gratian the author of the *Decretum*?

### Author or Compiler?

How did commentators in the middle ages think about authorship in
connection with the *Decretum* and similar works? In what sense did
they consider Gratian to be, or not be, the "author" of the *Decretum*?
Stephen of Tournai: no.[^2] Bonaventure on the *Sentences* of Peter
Lombard: yes.[^3]

[^2]: "Compositorem huius operis recte dixerim Gratianum, non
auctorem. Capitula namque a sanctis patribus edita in hoc volumine
composuit, i.e. ordinavit. Non eorum auctor vel conditor fuit, nisi
forte quis eum auctorem idcirco dicere velit, quoniam multa ex parte
sua sanctorum sententias distinguendo et exponendo in paragraphis
suis ponit." @schulte_summa_1965, 5 "I should properly say that
Gratian is the compiler of this work, not the author, for he brought
together in this volume---that is, he arranged---rulings enacted
by the holy Fathers. He was not their author or framer, unless
perchance someone wishes to say that he is thus the author since
he offered on his own in his dicta many things for clarifying and
explicating the opinions of the holy [Fathers]."

[^3]: Ad intelligentiam dictorum notandum, quod quadruplex est modus
faciendi librum. Aliquis enim scribit aliena, nihil addendo vel
mutando; et iste mere dicitur *scriptor*. Aliquis scribit aliena,
addendo, sed non de suo; et iste *compilator* dicitur. Aliquis
scribit et aliena et sua, sed aliena tamquam principalia, et sua
tamquam annexa ad evidentiam; et iste dicitur *commentator*, non
auctor. Aliquis scribit et sua et aliena, sed sua tanquam principalia,
aliena tamquam annexa ad confirmationem; et talis debet dici *auctor*.
Talis fuit Magister, qui sententias suas ponit et Patrum sententiis
confirmat. Unde vere debet dici auctor huius libri. (14-15)

    For someone writes out the words of other men without adding
    or changing anything, and he is called the scribe [*scriptor*]
    pure and simple. Someone else writes the words of other men,
    putting together material, but not his own, and he is called
    the compiler [*compilator*]. Someone else write the words of
    other men and also his own, but with those of other men comprising
    the principle part while his own are annexed merely to make
    clear the argument, and he is called the commentator [*commentator*],
    not the author. Someone else writes the words of other men and
    also of his own, but with his own forming the principle part
    and those of others being annexed merely by way of confirmation,
    and such a person should be called an author [*auctor*]. (Kraebel,
    98)

    Such was the Master [Peter Lombard], who put forward [*ponit*]
    his own opinions, and confirmed [them] from the opinions of the
    Fathers. Whence he truly ought to be called the author of this
    book. (trans. PLE)

### Barthes

Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death of the Author" holds a place
in literary studies somewhat similar to the place that Noonan's
"Gratian Slept Here" holds in canon law studies---it is a foundational
clearing of the ground of older ways of thinking in the field.
Although the title of the essay was a lightning-rod in 1980s theory
war polemics, taken as if Barthes were arguing that texts somehow
wrote themselves, Medievalists will recognize the French title of
the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*.
Barthes's essay is short, and at least compared with Foucault,
relatively free of arcane technical terms. Barthes was a literary
critic and scholar making an argument to other literary critics and
scholars against a well-established approach to the close-reading
of literary texts that focuses on the biographical and historical
context of the author and its relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the terms "Author" (and in one place "Author-God"),
capitalized starting at the third paragraph of the essay, to indicate
the conceptualization of authorship he is arguing against. An Author
is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a literary text,
and "is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father
to his child." [@barthes_death_1977, 145] The term "author" appears
throughout the essay where Barthes intends to use the word in its
more general and non-technical sense. Barthes argues that authors
cannot be Authors, since because all literary texts are socially
constructed, no person or persons can have a parent-child relationship
to a text: "We know now that a text is not a line of words releasing
a single 'theological' meaning (the 'message' of the Author-God)
but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none
of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations
drawn from the innumerable centres of culture." [@barthes_death_1977,
146] Barthes uses the term scriptor, never capitalized, to indicate
an alternative conceptualization of authorship in which the
performative aspect of the author's act is the central focus. Barthes
uses the terms "criticism" and "critic" to refer respectively to
the activity of close-reading a literary text and one engaging in
that activity. Translating the terms as "reading" and "reader" would
not be seriously misleading. In exactly one place toward the end
of the essay, Barthes uses the term "Critic" in opposition to Author
("the reign of the Author has also been that of the Critic"
[@barthes_death_1977, 147]) in a way that suggests that the Critic
(as opposed to the critic) is somehow called into being by, and
only exists in relation to, the Author (as opposed to author).

The *Decretum* is not a literary text, but the *dicta* have features
that make it worthwhile to at least consider whether Barthes offers
a useful and relevant perspective from which to assess Gratian's
authorship. The *dicta* are socially constructed as complete and
closed bodies of text: my stylometric analysis suggests that there
is no one author (in the way that term is generally used) for the
first-recension *dicta* taken as a totality, and no one author for
the second-recension *dicta* taken as a totality. The *dicta* are
socially constructed individually: each *dictum* is a "tissue of
quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture." The
*dicta* started life in a classroom setting, and therefore have
both a performative and a contemporaneous aspect ("there is no other
time than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written
*here* and *now*" [@barthes_death_1977, 145]) This makes Gratian a
scriptor according to Barthes's definition. The *dicta* are the
record of a particular close-reading of the authoritative texts.
This makes Gratian a critic, although not necessarily a Critic,
according to Barthes's definition.

Post-Noonan scholarship on the biography of Gratian by Grebner,
Winroth, and Pennington has been conducted in the spirit of an
Albert Schweitzer-like "quest of the historical Gratian." The
unifying idea has been that if we can identify the historical
Gratian, we will have identified the author of the *Decretum*, with
the authorship of the *Decretum* understood in a way very similar
to the way in which we might understand the authorship of a nineteenth
century novel. (It should be noted that Noonan's own conceptualization
of the authorship of the *Decretum* is more nuanced than that of
his successors.) In doing so, these historians have uncritically
accepted precisely the conceptualization of authorship that Barthes
is arguing against:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to
furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a
conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting
itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases:
society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author
has been found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.
[@barthes_death_1977, 147]

### Parking Lot

Pennington's "someone would have noticed" argument:

My main argument for not accepting the theory that there were two
Gratians is quite simple. It is difficult to imagine that if a
Gratian compiled the pre-Vulgate *Decretum*, and another person
doubled the size from ca. 2000 canons to ca. 4000, the first
generation of jurists after Gratian would have not noticed or not
known about the second Gratian’s work and blithely attributed what
was now a massive work to just "Gratian."[@pennington_biography_2018,
361-362.]

PLE: They did not notice or know because the *Decretum* came to the
attention of a significant audience only among the second, not the
first, generation of jurists after Gratian. An example of the kind
of change that did *not* escape the notice of the earliest widespread
audience was the division of the first part of the *Decretum* into
distinctions by Paucapalea. Note that Paucapalea, to whom the
division of the first part of the *Decretum* into distinctions was
attributed, was so far removed from the circumstances surrounding
the compilation of the *Decretum* that he did not even know the
name of its author. (This, in turn, is an argument in favor of the
case statements having been the first part of the *Decretum* reduced
to a written form. The logical alternative, that case statements
were written after the fact, would have to have taken place late
enough in the process that someone would have noticed.
