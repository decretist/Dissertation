### Authorship vs. Authority

When modern scholars talk about authorship, they are mostly interested
in the question of who wrote the exact words in a text, and at a
higher level, who provided the structure of the argument it contains.
My dissertation is about whether one, two, or many authors wrote
the exact words in the text of the *dicta* in the *Decretum*. The
stylometric techniques I used do not extend to the structure of the
arguments the *dicta* contain. The medieval sources we depend on for
most of the evidence about who wrote the *Decretum* were not uninterested
in the question of who wrote the exact words of the text, but that
question overlapped for them in a way that it does not for us with
the question of who the source of the text’s authority was. The
questions of the authorship and authority of the *Decretum* therefore
have to be considered distinctly although not separately from one
another.

### *Decretum* vs. *dicta*

Furthermore, the *Decretum* is mostly quoted text. Therefore, the
questions of the authorship and authority of the *Decretum* as a whole
and of the *dicta* have to be considered distinctly although not
separately from one another.

### Parking Lot

Pennington has argued against Winroth's claim that the development
from the first to the second recension of the *Decretum* was
accomplished in a single bound by someone other than the original
Gratian on the grounds that someone would have noticed and remarked
on such an extreme reconfiguration of the text:

> My main argument for not accepting the theory that there were two
Gratians is quite simple. It is difficult to imagine that if a
Gratian compiled the pre-Vulgate *Decretum*, and another person
doubled the size from ca. 2000 canons to ca. 4000, the first
generation of jurists after Gratian would have not noticed or not
known about the second Gratian’s work and blithely attributed what
was now a massive work to just "Gratian."[@pennington_biography_2018,
361-362.]

They did not notice or know, however, because the *Decretum* came
to the attention of a significant audience only among the second,
not the first, generation of jurists after Gratian. The earliest
significant change to the text to draw widespread notice was the
division of the first part of the *Decretum* into distinctions by
Paucapalea. Paucapalea, though, was far enough removed from the
circumstances surrounding the composition of the text that he did
not even know the name of its author. Ironically, Pennington's
"someone would have noticed" argument is wrong precisely because
his argument that the text of the *Decretum* underwent a long and
slow development process is right.

This, in turn, is an argument in favor of the case statements
having been one of the first parts of the *Decretum* reduced to a
stable written form. The logical alternative, that case statements
were written after the fact, would have to have taken place late
enough in the development of the text that someone would have
noticed.
