### Introduction

Post-Noonan scholarship on the biography of Gratian by Grebner,
Winroth, and Pennington[^1] has been conducted in the spirit of an
Albert Schweitzer-like "quest of the historical Gratian." **It is
worth noting that Noonan himself entertains a more nuanced concept
of authorship than Grebner, Winroth, and Pennington.** The unifying
idea has been that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we
will have identified the author of the *Decretum*, with the authorship
of the *Decretum* understood in a way very similar to the way in
which we might understand the authorship of a nineteenth century
novel. In doing so, these historians have uncritically accepted a
conceptualization of authorship that is anachronistic when applied
to medieval texts and has been discarded by literary scholarship
over the last half-century.

### Authorship vs. Authority

When modern scholars talk about authorship, they are mostly interested
in the question of who wrote the exact words in a text, and at a
higher level, who provided the structure of the argument it contains.
My dissertation is about whether one, two, or many authors wrote
the exact words in the text of the *dicta* in the *Decretum*. The
stylometric techniques I used do not extend to the structure of the
arguments the *dicta* contain. The medieval sources we depend on for
most of the evidence about who wrote the *Decretum* were not uninterested
in the question of who wrote the exact words of the text, but that
question overlapped for them in a way that it does not for us with
the question of who the source of the text’s authority was. The
questions of the authorship and authority of the *Decretum* therefore
have to be considered distinctly although not separately from one
another.

### *Decretum* vs. *dicta*

Furthermore, the *Decretum* is mostly quoted text. Therefore, the
questions of the authorship and authority of the *Decretum* as a whole
and of the *dicta* have to be considered distinctly although not
separately from one another.

### Was Gratian the author of the *Decretum*?

### Author or Compiler?

How did commentators in the middle ages think about authorship in
connection with the *Decretum* and similar works? In what sense did
they consider Gratian to be, or not be, the "author" of the *Decretum*?

### Parking Lot

Pennington's "someone would have noticed" argument:

My main argument for not accepting the theory that there were two
Gratians is quite simple. It is difficult to imagine that if a
Gratian compiled the pre-Vulgate *Decretum*, and another person
doubled the size from ca. 2000 canons to ca. 4000, the first
generation of jurists after Gratian would have not noticed or not
known about the second Gratian’s work and blithely attributed what
was now a massive work to just "Gratian."[@pennington_biography_2018,
361-362.]

PLE: They did not notice or know because the *Decretum* came to the
attention of a significant audience only among the second, not the
first, generation of jurists after Gratian. An example of the kind
of change that did *not* escape the notice of the earliest widespread
audience was the division of the first part of the *Decretum* into
distinctions by Paucapalea. Note that Paucapalea, to whom the
division of the first part of the *Decretum* into distinctions was
attributed, was so far removed from the circumstances surrounding
the compilation of the *Decretum* that he did not even know the
name of its author. (This, in turn, is an argument in favor of the
case statements having been the first part of the *Decretum* reduced
to a written form. The logical alternative, that case statements
were written after the fact, would have to have taken place late
enough in the process that someone would have noticed.
