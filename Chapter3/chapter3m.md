### Introduction

Post-Noonan scholarship on the biography of Gratian by Grebner,
Winroth, and Pennington[^1] has been conducted in the spirit of an
Albert Schweitzer-like "quest of the historical Gratian." **It is
worth noting that Noonan himself entertains a more nuanced concept
of authorship than Grebner, Winroth, and Pennington.** The unifying
idea has been that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we
will have identified the author of the *Decretum*, with the authorship
of the *Decretum* understood in a way very similar to the way in
which we might understand the authorship of a nineteenth century
novel. In doing so, these historians have uncritically accepted a
conceptualization of authorship that is anachronistic when applied
to medieval texts and has been discarded by literary scholarship
over the last half-century.

### Author or Compiler?

How did commentators in the middle ages think about authorship in
connection with the *Decretum* and similar works? In what sense did
they consider Gratian to be, or not be, the "author" of the *Decretum*?
Stephen of Tournai: no.[^2] Bonaventure on the *Sentences* of Peter
Lombard: yes.[^3]

[^2]: "Compositorem huius operis recte dixerim Gratianum, non
auctorem. Capitula namque a sanctis patribus edita in hoc volumine
composuit, i.e. ordinavit. Non eorum auctor vel conditor fuit, nisi
forte quis eum auctorem idcirco dicere velit, quoniam multa ex parte
sua sanctorum sententias distinguendo et exponendo in paragraphis
suis ponit." @schulte_summa_1965, 5 "I should properly say that
Gratian is the compiler of this work, not the author, for he brought
together in this volume---that is, he arranged---rulings enacted
by the holy Fathers. He was not their author or framer, unless
perchance someone wishes to say that he is thus the author since
he offered on his own in his dicta many things for clarifying and
explicating the opinions of the holy [Fathers]."

@kalb_studien_1983, 113-120, not from Schulte.

[^3]: Ad intelligentiam dictorum notandum, quod quadruplex est modus
faciendi librum. Aliquis enim scribit aliena, nihil addendo vel
mutando; et iste mere dicitur *scriptor*. Aliquis scribit aliena,
addendo, sed non de suo; et iste *compilator* dicitur. Aliquis
scribit et aliena et sua, sed aliena tamquam principalia, et sua
tamquam annexa ad evidentiam; et iste dicitur *commentator*, non
auctor. Aliquis scribit et sua et aliena, sed sua tanquam principalia,
aliena tamquam annexa ad confirmationem; et talis debet dici *auctor*.
Talis fuit Magister, qui sententias suas ponit et Patrum sententiis
confirmat. Unde vere debet dici auctor huius libri. (14-15)

    For someone writes out the words of other men without adding
    or changing anything, and he is called the scribe [*scriptor*]
    pure and simple. Someone else writes the words of other men,
    putting together material, but not his own, and he is called
    the compiler [*compilator*]. Someone else write the words of
    other men and also his own, but with those of other men comprising
    the principle part while his own are annexed merely to make
    clear the argument, and he is called the commentator [*commentator*],
    not the author. Someone else writes the words of other men and
    also of his own, but with his own forming the principle part
    and those of others being annexed merely by way of confirmation,
    and such a person should be called an author [*auctor*]. (Kraebel,
    98)

    Such was the Master [Peter Lombard], who put forward [*ponit*]
    his own opinions, and confirmed [them] from the opinions of the
    Fathers. Whence he truly ought to be called the author of this
    book. (trans. PLE)

### Gratian and Barthes

### Parking Lot

Pennington's "someone would have noticed" argument:

My main argument for not accepting the theory that there were two
Gratians is quite simple. It is difficult to imagine that if a
Gratian compiled the pre-Vulgate *Decretum*, and another person
doubled the size from ca. 2000 canons to ca. 4000, the first
generation of jurists after Gratian would have not noticed or not
known about the second Gratianâ€™s work and blithely attributed what
was now a massive work to just "Gratian."[@pennington_biography_2018,
361-362.]

PLE: They did not notice or know because the *Decretum* came to the
attention of a significant audience only among the second, not the
first, generation of jurists after Gratian. An example of the kind
of change that did *not* escape the notice of the earliest widespread
audience was the division of the first part of the *Decretum* into
distinctions by Paucapalea. Note that Paucapalea, to whom the
division of the first part of the *Decretum* into distinctions was
attributed, was so far removed from the circumstances surrounding
the compilation of the *Decretum* that he did not even know the
name of its author. (This, in turn, is an argument in favor of the
case statements having been the first part of the *Decretum* reduced
to a written form. The logical alternative, that case statements
were written after the fact, would have to have taken place late
enough in the process that someone would have noticed.
