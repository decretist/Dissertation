### Authorship vs. Authority

When modern scholars talk about authorship, they are mostly interested
in the question of who wrote the exact words in a text, and at a
higher level, who provided the structure of the argument it contains.
My dissertation is about whether one, two, or many authors wrote
the exact words in the text of the *dicta* in the *Decretum*. The
stylometric techniques I used do not extend to the structure of the
arguments the *dicta* contain. The medieval sources we depend on for
most of the evidence about who wrote the *Decretum* were not uninterested
in the question of who wrote the exact words of the text, but that
question overlapped for them in a way that it does not for us with
the question of who the source of the textâ€™s authority was. The
questions of the authorship and authority of the *Decretum* therefore
have to be considered distinctly although not separately from one
another.
