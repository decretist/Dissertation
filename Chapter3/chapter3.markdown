## Gratian

Very little is known about the historical Gratian, and almost everything
that previous generations thought was known about Gratian has proved, on
closer examination, to be myth.[1] On the evidence found in the
*Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been less interested in contemporary
ecclesiastical or secular politics in general, and in the Investiture
Controversy (1076-1122) in particular, than some modern scholars think
he ought to have been. Gratian similarly seems, based on the relatively
limited use he makes in the *Decretum* of material from the *Codex* and
*Digest* of Justinian, to have been either less interested in, or less
aware of, the revival of the study of Roman law in the early twelfth
century than we think he ought to have been. On the other hand, he seems
to have been more aware of, and more interested in, the emergence of
scholastic theology in northern France than we can easily explain.[2]

### Noonan

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself is John
T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian slept here: The
changing identity of the father of the systematic study of canon law".
Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating that there is no sound
historical basis for most of the affirmative statements that many
mid-twentieth century handbooks and reference works presented as
commonplace.[3] It is unnecessary to exhaustively catalog all of the
many Gratian myths that Noonan debunked. A single example, his
examination of the history of the claim that Gratian was a Camaldolese
monk at the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna (one of the
most prominent elements of the mythology surrounding Gratian), is
sufficient to illustrate the nature of Noonan's method and conclusions.

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that Gratian
"was staying" (*stabat*) at the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor
while working as a rubricator.[4] Odofredus did not indicate the basis
for his statement that Gratian had been a resident of Saints Felix and
Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a monk. In 1758, Camaldolese
scholars Mittarelli and Costadono discovered papal privileges conferred
in 1113 and 1153 identifying Saints Felix and Nabor as Camaldolese, and
inferred from them that the monastery---and by extension Gratian
himself---had been Camaldolese during the intervening years. The claim
that Gratian had a connection to the Camaldolese order attracted
criticism in the eighteenth century, and fell out of favor in the
nineteenth century, but was put back into circulation in the
mid-twentieth century by Van Hove.[5]

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and the
courtroom to the historical record. Noonan relied heavily on the legal
hearsay standard as understood and applied by twentieth-century American
courts of law as the basis for his debunking of much Gratian mythology.
By Noonan's standards, the statement of Odofredus---hearsay, not
attributed to a source, a century after the fact---is nothing more than
legend.

Winroth has questioned whether this is an appropriate standard for
evaluating historical evidence.[6] Noonan's insistence on adhering to
the courtroom rules of evidence can seem like overkill. If, after all,
the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna was in the hands of
Camaldolese communities in 1113 and 1153, it does not seem unreasonable
to infer that it was in the hands of one in the 1120s and 1130s when
Gratian was putatively associated with the foundation, whatever we think
the nature of that association to have been. But Noonan's caution seems
justified when we consider, for example, Southern's having seized upon
the one thinly-sourced datum of the Camaldolese connection as the
foundation for his entire reconstruction of Gratian's intentions and
motivations in undertaking the *Decretum* project, including a
peremptory dismissal of any possibility that Gratian had a teaching
career.[7]

Noonan did leave open one affirmative possibility, that a Gratian who
was recorded as having participated in an 1143 case in Venice as one of
three legal consultants ("Magister Walfredus", "Gratianus", and
"Moysis", in that order)[8] advising a three-judge panel presided over
by a papal legate, Cardinal Goizo, might be the same Gratian responsible
for the *Decretum*.

> But we can say that it is possible, even plausible, that the unbiased
> notary who recorded the scene at S. Marco is the only person to have
> left an eyewitness account of Gratian.[9]

<!--
There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to be determined.
One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three distinctive parts,
with several distinctive sections within the parts, and these parts
have undergone editing as to chapter headings, chapter insertions,
and chapter order. Whatever the later formal ascription, is Gratian
responsible for all the parts? The other difficulty is the range of
roles the one 'responsible' person might have had [em-dash] compiler,
commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one or all? The
difficulties relate to each other, because evidence that Gratian
was, say, the commentator of Part II does not establish what role
he had in Part I. @noonan_gratian_1979, 162-163.
  -->

**Transition: Noonan wrote before the discovery of the first recension;
recent (post-1996) discussion of the identity of Gratian necessarily
focus on accounting for the existence of the first and second
recensions.**

<!--
### Grebner
It's not clear whether I need separate section for Grebner.

Does Grebner's prosopographic analysis put Gratian on the "right"
side of the Anacletian schism (i.e., on the same side as Haimeric
with the Innocentians)?
  -->

### Winroth

Winroth's arguments in chapters 1-5 of *The Making of Gratian's
Decretum* are agnostic as to whether Gratian 1 is the same person as
Gratian 2.

> "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore chosen
> to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the author of
> the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not intended to
> suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have been the same
> person."[11]

The question of authorial identity is not relevant to the primary
argument that Winroth advances in those chapters, which is that the
Admont, Barcelona, and Florence manuscripts represent a coherent first
recension of the *Decretum* rather than an abbreviation. In chapter 6
and in his conclusion, however, Winroth observes that the second
recension reflects a considerably more sophisticated legal culture than
that reflected in the first recension, notably in the reception of
concepts and terminology from the study of Roman law, and argues that it
is unlikely that one author underwent such an intellectual evolution in
a single generation.[12]

Winroth interprets an entry in a Siena necrology (Siena, Biblioteca
communale degli Intronati F12, f.5r) as evidence that Gratian died as
bishop of Chiusi on the feast day of St Lawrence (August 10) in either
1144 or 1145.[13]

### Pennington

Pennington builds on Larson's conjecture that the canon referred to at
D.63 d.p.c.34 in the first recension and later incorporated as D.63 c.35
in the second recension is not canon 28 from the Second Lateran Council
(1139), but rather a canon from an earlier council or synod convened by
Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was reissued, a common practice in the
early twelfth century, at Lateran II.[14] Pennington supports Larson's
conjecture by noting that the text of the canon as it appears in the
*Decretum* includes variants (*facta fuerit* vs *fuerit celebrata*, and
*consensus* vs *assensus*) found in none of the twenty manuscript
witnesses to the Lateran II canons edited by Martin Brett.[15]
Pennington argues that there is enough doubt as to whether D.63 d.p.c.34
refers to canon 28 from Lateran II---as opposed to a canon from an
earlier council or synod later reissued with minor textual variations as
canon 28 at Lateran II---that it cannot be used as the sole or primary
basis for imposing a *terminus post quem* of 1139 on the first recension
of the *Decretum*.

Pennington, building on Eichbauer's findings, argues that because the
number of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in both the
margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short of the number that
would be expected if they had been copied from a Vulgate *Decretum* (87
are missing from Aa, and 62 are missing from Fd), these manuscripts
represent an intermediate "next-to-last" stage in the development of the
*Decretum* text intermediate the pre-Vulgate and Vulgate versions.[16]
Furthermore, the fact that the Lateran II canons *are* present in this
"next-to-last" stage undermines the argument going back to Fransen and
supported by Lenherr that the Lateran II canons are a last-minute
addition, and poorly if at all integrated into the argument of the
*Decretum*.[17] **Pennington also cites early manuscripts of the
*Decretum* with 99 and 100 distinctions in Part I as evidence for the
continuous evolution of the text between the first and second
recensions.**

<!--
Pennington assumes an Iberian origin for Bc, but wasn't it originally
Italian?
  -->

Pennington's strongest argument in favor of his position on Sg is not an
abbreviation is that the unique *Causa Prima* (an ordered subset of
canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension of the *Decretum*)
includes neither texts from the *tractatus de legibus* (distinctions
1-20) nor from the "epilogue" (distinctions 81-101). Moreover, four
cases, 24-26 and 28, are missing from Sg entirely. Why, Pennington asks,
would an abbreviator do this?

<!--
The subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension
of the *Decretum* from which *Causa Prima* in the Sg manuscript is
composed is ordered, with the relatively insignificant exception
that the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7
are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653]
  -->

There are two aspects to Pennington's reservations about identifying the
Gratian named in the Siena necrology with the author of the *Decretum*.
Pennington is open to the possibility that the author of the *Decretum*
eventually became a bishop somewhere, but questions whether the person
named in the necrology was either the bishop of Chiusi, or the author of
the *Decretum*. He notes that the necrology refers to "Gratian of
Chiusi, bishop", not to "Gratian, bishop of Chiusi." His second
reservation concerning the identification of the Gratian mentioned in
the Siena necrology as "the Gratian is closely related to his
reservation about Grebner's identification of the Gratian mentioned in
the record of the 1143 Venice court case: neither record accords Gratian
the kind of prominence that might be expected for a figure of such
importance. Gratian appears second on the list of the three legal
consultants in the Venice case, and is not referred to with the
honorific title "*Magister*." And the Siena necrology records nothing
beyond the bare facts of a name, a day (but not year) of death, and that
the defunct had been a bishop from or of Chiusi.

<!--
Pennington claims to be arguing that there was one Gratian, but is
in fact arguing that Gratian composed the *Decretum* incrementally
over the course of a teaching career spanning several decades, which
is not quite the same thing. Also, Pennington does not address
Winroth's content-based arguments in favor of the two-author
hypothesis (e.g., differences between the first and second recensions
in terms of the levels of sophistication in the use of Justinianic
Roman Law).
  -->

### Gratian's teaching career

Evidence concerning Gratian's career as a teacher of canon law is
contradictory. Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum* have
seen it as a teaching text, both in the sense that its intended use (or
at least one of its intended uses) was as an introductory textbook, and
also in the sense that it reflected the author's experience as a
classroom teacher. On the one hand, the early manuscript tradition for
the *Decretum* displays enough variation, even among the first-recension
manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P, to suggest that the text developed
continuously over the span of, and in parallel with, a relatively long
teaching career---perhaps a decade or more. On the other hand, Gratian's
personal obscurity is so profound---Stephan Kuttner compared Gratian to
the anonymous builders of Gothic cathedrals[18]---as to suggest a short,
or even no, teaching career.[19]

Considering the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the author
of the foundational textbook for the study of canon law in the classical
period, one of the truly stellar intellectual achievements of the
renaissance of the twelfth century, his complete absence from the kinds
of academic genealogies and origin stories that Odofredus (†1265) handed
down to his own Roman law students is striking indeed.[20]

We might be better able to assess Gratian's teaching career and how it
influenced the compilation and transmission of the *Decretum* were we in
a position to positively identify at least a few of his students. Here
again, however, the evidence is mixed at best. Three twelfth-century
canonist have, with varying degrees of plausibility, been identified as
having been students of Gratian: Paucapalea (fl. 1140s), Simon of
Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179), Omnebene (d. 1185).

#### Paucapalea

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early period of
the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's immediate
footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was "\[a\] pupil of
Gratian and the author of the first commentary on the *Decretum*".[21]
But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea does not refer to
Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis ipsa decreta sunt
materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are the subject matter of the
master producing this work."[22]

The omission is potentially significant. Prefaces to academic books in
the twelfth century formed a recognized genre with well-established
conventions. In an age resistant to any attempt by the human present to
appropriate the authority of the divinely-inspired past, a commentator
like Paucapalea would have been expected to offer an explicit statement
in his preface affirming the authority of both the work commented on and
its author. If Paucapalea had had something to say about the authority
of Gratian, his readers would have expected him to do so in his preface.
That he did not suggests that he may not have known enough about Gratian
to credibly do so.[23]

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows both
that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work: "*In
extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine domini atque
baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat, et in his suum
tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the dedication of
churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism, and also
confirmation, and with these things concludes his treatise."[24]

If Rambaud is correct that *de Consecratione* was not part of the
original *Decretum*, the fact that Paucapalea attributed it to the same
unnamed master responsible for rest of the text on which he was
commenting strongly suggests that he did not have direct knowledge of
Gratian or his plan of work.

#### Omnibonus or Omnebene

Omnibonus or Omnebene (d.1185) composed an adaptation or transformation
of the *Decretum* in the 1150s.[25] The basis for the claim that
Omnebene was a student of Gratian is an entry for the year 1130 in the
chronicle of Norman monk Robert of Torigni (†1186)

> *Gratianus episcopus Clusinus coadunavit decreta valde utilia ex
> decretis, canonibus, doctoribus, legibus Romanis, sufficientia ad
> omnes ecclesiasticas causas decidendas, que frequentantur in curia
> Romana et in aliis curiis ecclesiasticis. Hec postmodum abbreviavit
> magister Omnebonum episcopus Veronensis, qui fuerat eius discipulus.*
> (Gratian bishop of Chiusi brought together very useful decrees out of
> decrees, canons, doctors, Roman laws, sufficient for deciding all
> ecclesiastical cases, which are resorted to at the Roman curia and in
> other ecclesiastical courts. Master Omnebonum bishop of Verona, who
> had been his student, afterwards abbreviated them.)[26]

Although the evidence of Robert's chronicle is by Noonan's standard
hearsay, Robert's reputation as a well-informed source concerning
Gratian has improved in recent years since the Siena necrology has made
the identification of Gratian as bishop of Chiusi more probable.

The dates do not preclude Omnebene's having been a student of Gratian.
Although Omnebene lived into the 1180s, the adaptation itself seems to
date from around 1156, perhaps a decade and a half after the end of
whatever teaching career Gratian may have had, and at precisely the
moment that continent-wide interest in the text was increasing most
rapidly.[27]

#### Simon of Bisignano

Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179) was the author of a *Summa
decretorum* dated c.1177-79, and a number of glosses on the *Decretum*
are attributed to him.[28] The evidence that Simon of Bisignano was a
student of Gratian’s comes from references within his writings.[29]
Simon refers to himself as *discipulus* and to Gratian as *magister* in
at least two places in his *Summa* (**Landau says "frequently"**). There
is, however a hiatus of almost four decades between the latest plausible
date for the end of Gratian's teaching career, and the documentary
evidence we have for Simon's professional career as a canonist. Although
it is not chronologically impossible for Simon to have been Gratian's
student, it seems more likely that he described himself as *discipulus*
in something like the same sense that we might describe contemporary
scholars like Chodorow, Pennington, and Winroth as "students of
Gratian".

### Epilogue

By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the systematic study of
canon law had evolved in a direction of which its father Gratian would
probably not have approved, and which he may even have had difficulty
recognizing as the same practical or applied branch of theology his own
work presupposed it to be. After around 1190, the attention of both
academic and practicing canonists decisively turned away from
theological jurisprudence in the tradition of Gratian, based on a rich
collection of scriptural, patristic, conciliar, and papal source texts,
and towards a much more narrowly circumscribed technical jurisprudence
focused exclusively on contemporary papal decretals.

[2] See Stephan Kuttner, “The Father of the Science of Canon Law,”

program as it had been developed in the intervening forty years by
scholastic theology, most notably by Abelard, and not in its original
form: scholastic theology got the program from Ivo, Gratian got it from
scholastic theology. See also D. E. Luscombe, “Abelard and the Decretum

[3] Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here.”

[4] Noonan identifies Odofredus as the source for associating Gratian
with Saints Felix and Nabor. Noonan, , 148; but cf. R. W. Southern,
*Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe*, vol. 1 (Oxford, UK
; Cambridge, Mass., USA: Blackwell, 1995), 286n5. Southern draws
attention to an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the
*Decretum*, Bibliothèque publique et universitaire, MS Lat. 60: *Anno
domini MCL a Gratiano S. Feliciani Bononiensis monacho editum*.
Pennington does not identify the manuscript as one known to date from
the twelfth century (see Kenneth Pennington,
[Gratianus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a242),
*Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists*), and
of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript was
produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription as
independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian and
Saints Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible that it
predates Odofredus.

[5] See Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here”, 150-151. Alphonse van Hove,
*Prolegomena ad Codicem iuris canonici*, Editio artera auctior et
emendatior, Commentarium Lovaniense in Codicem iuris canonici, v. 1, t.
1 (Mechlinae: H. Dessain, 1945) had an outsized impact on the trajectory
of medieval canon law studies in twentieth century North America because
of its having been used by the 1964 Yale seminar led by Peter Landau in
the absence of Stephan Kuttner, who was undergoing treatment for cancer
at the time. Seminar participants including Charles Donahue and Robert
Somerville went on to have unusually influential academic careers in the
field (Donahue at Harvard, and Somerville at Columbia where he was
Winroth's dissertation advisor).

[6] "Noonan used sound historical methods, but he chose, as a
distinguished professor of law and later a prominent judge, to couch his
method in lawyerly terms, talking about hearsay and wanting to
cross-examine witnesses. To make any headway with as complex and
difficult a problem as Gratian's biography, it will be important to
cling a bit more closely than Noonan did to classical historical
methodology and terminology, as they have been codified from the late
nineteenth century on." Winroth, “Where Gratian Slept”, 106.

[7] R.W. Southern takes an extreme position with respect to Gratian's
teaching career, citing as late as 1995 Gratian's supposed association
with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that he had never been
a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death affirmed that Gratian was a
Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian Order, a small Italian branch of
the Benedictines, which combined austerity of life with considerable
freedom to contribute to the work of the Church in a wide variety of
ways. This is what Gratian did. He engaged in a very un-monastic branch
of study, and produced a law book which became the most widely
distributed and probably most generally used of all the masterpieces of
twelfth-century learning." "the book, and not the teaching of pupils,
was the offering Gratian's monastic life brought to the Church".
(Southern, *Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe*,
1:286–87, 304).

[8] Pennngton reads a great deal into the order (why wasn't Gratian
referred to first?) and the honorifics (why wasn't Gratian referred to
as "Magister"?). Kenneth Pennington, “The Biography of Gratian, the
Father of Canon Law,” in *A Service Beyond All Recompense*, ed. Kurt
Martens (Catholic University of America Press, 2018), 359–92, 387-388.
There is, however, no reason to assume that the notary who reported on
the proceedings would necessarily have been well-informed about Gratian,
who was, after all, not a local figure in Venice.

broader context: "The argument about two authors is based on textual
(you could almost say literary) analysis: formulations, practices of
organization, source use, etc. Justinian’s Roman law books is really the
only category of source only used in one of the two recensions. I used
to think that there were other sources, such as 3L, that were only used
in the second recension, but this turned out to be an accident of the
specific sections I used as case studies (C. 24 and C.11 q.3)." (Anders
Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May 2021).

[13] See Winroth, “Where Gratian Slept”. The article expands on a
presentation given by Winroth at the Fourteenth International Congress
of Medieval Canon Law, Toronto, 2012.

[14] **Placeholder for Pennington, Larson footnote** Pennington asserts
that "\[t\]he main reason that Winroth created a second 'Gratian' is
because of a text \[D.63 d.p.c.34\] that is found in all pre-Vulgate
manuscripts." Pennington, “The Biography of Gratian, the Father of Canon
Law”, 362. D.63 d.p.c.34 *is* central to Winroth's arguments in favor of
a late date for the first recension (1139), and for a short teaching
career for Gratian, but is not relevant to his argument in favor of the
two-author hypothesis. "The reference to Lateran II only proves that the
*Decretum*, as transmitted by extant manuscripts (and I have checked
several dozens, 'vulgate' as well as 'pre-vulgate'), cannot have been
written before 1139." (Anders Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May
2021). As noted in Chapter 2 and the footnote above, the original basis
for Winroth's two-author hypothesis was that the second recension makes
much more sophisticated use of Roman law concepts and terminology than
the first recension.

367–68.

[18] "He is one of those deeply admirable men of pious modesty, like the
builders of the medieval cathedrals, whose person is hidden and effaced
completely behind their immortal works." (Kuttner, “The Father of the
Science of Canon Law,” 4).

[19] **Winroth argues for a short teaching career, Southern argues for
no teaching career.** Southern also asserts that no one claims to have
been Gratian's student---"none of the earliest users of his work claims
to have been taught by him". "although other scholars made some very
early alterations and additions to the text of the *Decretum*, none of
them claimed to have been taught by him." (Southern, *Scholastic
Humanism and the Unification of Europe*, 1:287, 304). **Does Southern
provide footnotes to support these statements?**

[20] **Expand:** The tradition of Roman law teaching in Bologna
preserved an elaborate genealogy of masters and their students: Pepo
preceded Wernerius \[Irnerius\], who taught the Four Doctors. Odofredus
is an important source for this tradition, and his remarks about
Irnerius can be found in his commentary on *Dig.* 1.1.6. Odofredus,
*Lectura super Digesto veteri*, (2 volumes, Lyon: 1550-1552; repr.
Bologna 1967-1968). For a short excerpt from the Latin text with
accompanying English translation, see (Charles Radding, *The Origins of
Medieval Jurisprudence: Pavia and Bologna, 850- 1150* (New Haven: Yale
University Press, 1988), 159–60) **See also Pennington "Big Bang".**
Note that Odofredus is also the source for associating Gratian with the
monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor. (Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here,”
148).

<CAVSA XXVII> &lt;Q.II&gt; § *Sequitur secunda questio* Sacram et
authenticam pie recordationis Gratianus de matrimonio distinctionem
composuit, quam quidam inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem et
simplicium potibus inuidentes more seuorum animalium aquas limpidas
turbauerunt. Gratianus uero, canonum habita notitia et mente perspecta,
dixit inter sponsum et sponsam esse matrimonium, sed initiatum; inter
uirum et uxorem consummatum. Sed quoniam non est discipulus super
magistrum nec debet securis contra eum qui secat gloriari timemus os
nostrum in celum mittere et eum reprehendere cuius non sumus digni
soluere corrigiam calceamenti.

Note that the phrase "sed inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem" also
occurs in Rufinus's treatment of the same question, C.27 q.2. (Rufinus,
*Summa Decretorum*, ed. Heinrich Singer (Aalen : Paderborn: Scientia
Verlag ; F. Schöningh, 1963), 440).

Gratian of pious remembrance composed a sacred and *authenticam*
distinction concerning marriage, *quam quidam inanis glorie aucupes
fecere bifrontem* and not seeing with the drinks of the simple, \[they\]
troubled clear waters in the manner of *seuorum* animals. But Gratian
*habita notitia* of the canon and *mente perspecta*, said that matrimony
is between spouse and spouse, but having been consecrated (*initiatum*),
is consummated between husband and wife. But since the disciple is not
above his master (Matthew 10:24, Luke 6:40), and the axe (*securis*)
ought not boast (*gloriari*) against him who cuts (*secat*) (Isaiah
10:15), we fear to send our mouth into heaven (Psalm 72:9?) and to find
fault with him the string (*corrigiam*) of whose shoes we are not worthy
to loosen (John 1:27) (PLE).

<DISTINCTIO IIII> 31. *Solet queri* Quod quamuis Magister noster
docuerit, nos tamen in hoc nolumus eum imitari.

Although our master taught that, we nevertheless do not wish to imitate
him in this (PLE).
