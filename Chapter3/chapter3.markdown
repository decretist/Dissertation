## Gratian

Very little is known about the historical Gratian, and almost everything
that previous generations thought was known about Gratian has proved, on
closer examination, to be myth.[1] On the evidence found in the
*Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been less interested in contemporary
ecclesiastical or secular politics in general, and in the Investiture
Controversy (1076-1122) in particular, than some modern scholars think
he ought to have been. Gratian similarly seems, based on the relatively
limited use he makes in the *Decretum* of material from the *Codex* and
*Digest* of Justinian, to have been either less interested in, or less
well-informed about, the revival of the study of Roman law in the early
twelfth century than we think he ought to have been. On the other hand,
he seems to have been more well-informed about, and more interested in,
the emergence of scholastic theology in northern France than we can
easily explain.[2]

### Noonan

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself is John
T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian slept here: The
changing identity of the father of the systematic study of canon law".
Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating that there is no sound
historical basis for most of the affirmative statements that many
mid-twentieth century handbooks and reference works presented as
commonplace.[3] It is unnecessary to exhaustively catalog all of the
many Gratian myths that Noonan debunked. A single example, his
examination of the history of the claim that Gratian was a Camaldolese
monk at the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna---one of the
most prominent elements of the mythology surrounding Gratian---is
sufficient to illustrate the nature of Noonan's method and conclusions.

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that Gratian
"was staying" (*stabat*) at the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor
while working as a rubricator.[4] Odofredus did not indicate the basis
for his statement that Gratian had been resident at Saints Felix and
Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a monk. In 1758, Camaldolese
scholars Mittarelli and Costadono discovered papal privileges conferred
in 1113 and 1153 identifying Saints Felix and Nabor as Camaldolese, and
inferred from them that the monastery---and by extension Gratian
himself---had been Camaldolese during the intervening years. The claim
that Gratian had a connection to the Camaldolese order attracted
criticism in the eighteenth century, and fell out of favor in the
nineteenth century, before being put back into circulation in the
mid-twentieth century by Van Hove.[5]

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and the
courtroom to the historical record. Noonan relied heavily on the legal
hearsay standard as understood and applied by twentieth-century American
courts of law as the basis for his debunking of much Gratian mythology.
By Noonan's standards, the statement of Odofredus---hearsay, not
attributed to a source, a century after the fact---is nothing more than
legend.

Winroth has questioned whether this is an appropriate standard for
evaluating historical evidence.[6] Noonan's insistence on adhering to
the courtroom rules of evidence can seem like overkill. If, after all,
the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna was in the hands of
Camaldolese communities in 1113 and 1153, it does not seem unreasonable
to infer that it was in the hands of one in the 1120s and 1130s when
Gratian was putatively associated with the foundation, whatever we think
the nature of that association to have been. But Noonan's caution seems
justified when we consider, for example, Southern's having seized upon
the one thinly-sourced datum of the Camaldolese connection as the
foundation for his entire reconstruction of Gratian's intentions and
motivations in undertaking the *Decretum* project, including a
peremptory dismissal of any possibility that Gratian had a teaching
career.[7]

<!--

Noonan briefly discusses an entry in the chronicle of Robert of
Torigny identifying Gratian as bishop of Chiusi. Noonan considers
that claim unverifiable.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 153-154] The
since-discovered Siena necrology makes Robert's identification more
plausible, though by no means certain.

  -->

Noonan's wide-ranging skepticism extended considerably further than this
or that alleged fact about Gratian's biography; he expressed significant
doubt about the assumption that a text like the *Decretum* had a single
author:

> There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to be
> determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three distinctive
> parts, with several distinctive sections within the parts, and these
> parts have undergone editing as to chapter headings, chapter
> insertions, and chapter order. Whatever the later formal ascription,
> is Gratian responsible for all the parts? The other difficulty is the
> range of roles the one 'responsible' person might have had---compiler,
> commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one or all? The
> difficulties relate to each other, because evidence that Gratian was,
> say, the commentator of Part II does not establish what role he had in
> Part I.[8]

Noonan did leave open one affirmative possibility, that a Gratian who
was recorded as having participated in an 1143 case in Venice as one of
three legal consultants ("magister Walfredus", "Gratianus", and
"Moysis", in that order)[9] advising a three-judge panel presided over
by a papal legate, Cardinal Goizo, might be the same Gratian responsible
for the *Decretum*.

> But we can say that it is possible, even plausible, that the unbiased
> notary who recorded the scene at S. Marco is the only person to have
> left an eyewitness account of Gratian.[10]

Noonan concludes that

> we have reason to believe that Gratian composed and commented upon a
> substantial portion of the Concordia. In such composition and
> commentary he revealed himself to be a teacher with theological
> knowledge and interests and a lawyer's point of view. He worked in
> Bologna in the 1130s and 1140s. Beyond these conclusions, we have
> unverified hearsay, palpable legend, and the silent figure in the
> shadows of S. Marco.[11]

This, then, is our starting point. Noonan wrote, however, before
Winroth's discovery of the first recension. Scholarship on the identity
of Gratian in this century has necessarily had to take into account both
Noonan's pruning of his biography and the existence of the first and
second recensions.

### Grebner

One of the earliest attempts to do so was Gundula Grebner's "Lay
patronate in Bologna in the first half of the 12th century: Regular
canons, notaries, and the *Decretum*."[12] Grebner's article is usually
cited in connection with the 1143 court case: "Recently, Gundula Grebner
uncovered more evidence that would confirm Gratian's presence in a
Venetian courtroom and change Noonan's plausible to certain."[13]

<!--

Grebner's prosopographic analysis appears to put Gratian on the
"right" side of the Anacletian schism (i.e., on the same side as
Haimeric with the Innocentians).

  -->

### Winroth

Winroth's arguments in chapters 1-5 of *The Making of Gratian's
Decretum* are agnostic as to whether Gratian 1 is the same person as
Gratian 2.

> "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore chosen
> to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the author of
> the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not intended to
> suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have been the same
> person."[14]

The question of authorial identity is not relevant to the primary
argument that Winroth advances in those chapters, which is that the
Admont, Barcelona, and Florence manuscripts represent a coherent first
recension of the *Decretum* rather than an abbreviation. In chapter 6
and in his conclusion, however, Winroth observes that the second
recension reflects a considerably more sophisticated legal culture than
that reflected in the first recension, notably in the reception of
concepts and terminology from the study of Roman law, and argues that it
is unlikely that one author underwent such an intellectual evolution in
a single generation.[15]

Winroth is strongly committed to a late date (1139) for the first
recension on the grounds that he thinks D.63 d.p.c.34 *must* refer to
canon 28 from the Second Lateran Council of 1139. That first-recension
*dictum* makes a reference to a canon, D.63 c.35, that was later
incorporated into the text of the *Decretum* as D.63 c.35 in the second
recension.[16]

Winroth rejects claims that the Sg manuscript of the *Decretum* is
descended from a version earlier than the first recension, and argues
that it is instead an abbreviation of the first recension with some
interpolations from the second. Winroth therefore does not see the
existence of Sg as a reason to assume either a long teaching career for
Gratian or a long period of incremental development for the text of the
*Decretum*.

Finally, Winroth accepts an entry in a Siena necrology (Siena,
Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati F.I.2, f.5r) brought to scholarly
attention by Francesco Reali as evidence that Gratian the author of the
first recension died as bishop of Chiusi on the feast day of St Lawrence
(August 10) in either 1144 or 1145.[17] The datum provided by the
necrology, recording the death of a "Gratian of Chiusi, bishop",
considered along with an axiomatic assumption of an 1139 date for the
first recension, strengthens the case from Winroth's perspective that
Gratian, having been elevated to a bishopric not long after having
finished work on the first recension, was unlikely to have been the
author of the second recension.

#### Sg

Much of the debate over whether the *Decretum* was the result of a
continuous or discontinuous process of composition focused on the Sankt
Gallen 673 (Sg) manuscript. Pennington and some of his students have
argued that it represented, at some unknown number of removes, an
earlier version of the *Decretum* than Winroth's first recension.
Winroth and Wei have argued that Sg was a relatively uninteresting
abbreviation of a first recension manuscript with some second recension
interpolations.[18]

The version of the *Decretum* preserved in the Sankt Gallen
Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript contains somewhat fewer than 1,050
canons,[19] and is therefore considerably shorter than either the first
recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945) versions of the
text.[20] Formally, Sg is not divided into parts; all of its content is
presented in the form of cases. The first case, however, is unique to
Sg, and is referred to as *Causa Prima* to distinguish it from the
*Causa* I found in all other pre-vulgate and vulgate versions of the
*Decretum*. (*Causa* I appears as *Causa* II in Sg.) It contains a
subset of canons and *dicta* found in Part I, presented in almost
exactly the same order in which they appear in other versions of the
*Decretum*. (There is one relatively minor exception with respect to the
ordering of the texts, the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4,
c.6, and c.7 are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6
and D.31 c.7.)[21] Notably, *Causa Prima* contains no texts (canons or
*dicta*) from the *tractatus de legibus* (distinctions 1-20) and none
from Gratian's "epilogue" (distinctions 81-101).

### Pennington

Pennington builds on Larson's conjecture that the canon referred to at
D.63 d.p.c.34 in the first recension and later incorporated as D.63 c.35
in the second recension is not canon 28 from the Second Lateran Council
(1139), but rather a canon from an earlier council or synod convened by
Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was reissued, a common practice in the
early twelfth century, at Lateran II.[22] Pennington supports Larson's
conjecture by noting that the text of the canon as it appears in the
*Decretum* includes variants (*facta fuerit* vs *fuerit celebrata*, and
*consensus* vs *assensus*) found in none of the twenty manuscript
witnesses to the Lateran II canons edited by Martin Brett.[23]
Pennington argues that there is enough doubt as to whether D.63 d.p.c.34
refers to canon 28 from Lateran II---as opposed to a canon from an
earlier council or synod later reissued with minor textual variations as
canon 28 at Lateran II---that it cannot be used as the sole or primary
basis for imposing a *terminus post quem* of 1139 on the first recension
of the *Decretum*.

Pennington, building on Eichbauer's findings, argues that because the
number of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in both the
margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short of the number that
would be expected if they had been copied from a Vulgate *Decretum* (87
are missing from Aa, and 62 are missing from Fd), these manuscripts
represent an intermediate "next-to-last" stage in the development of the
*Decretum* text intermediate the pre-Vulgate and Vulgate versions.[24]
Furthermore, the fact that the Lateran II canons *are* present in this
"next-to-last" stage undermines the argument going back to Fransen and
supported by Lenherr that the Lateran II canons are a last-minute
addition, and poorly if at all integrated into the argument of the
*Decretum*.[25] **Pennington also cites early manuscripts of the
*Decretum* with 99 and 100 distinctions in Part I as evidence for the
continuous evolution of the text between the first and second
recensions.**

<!--

Pennington assumes an Iberian origin for Bc, but wasn't it originally
Italian?

  -->

Pennington's strongest argument in favor of his position on Sg is not an
abbreviation is that the unique *Causa Prima* (an ordered subset of
canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension of the *Decretum*)
includes neither texts from the *tractatus de legibus* (distinctions
1-20) nor from the "epilogue" (distinctions 81-101). Moreover, four
cases, 24-26 and 28, are missing from Sg entirely. Why, Pennington asks,
would an abbreviator do this?

<!--

The subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension
of the *Decretum* from which *Causa Prima* in the Sg manuscript is
composed is ordered, with the relatively insignificant exception
that the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7
are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653]

  -->

There are two aspects to Pennington's reservations about identifying the
Gratian named in the Siena necrology with the author of the *Decretum*.
Pennington is open to the possibility that the author of the *Decretum*
eventually became a bishop somewhere, but questions whether the person
named in the necrology was either the bishop of Chiusi, or the author of
the *Decretum*. He notes that the necrology refers to "Gratian of
Chiusi, bishop", not to "Gratian, bishop of Chiusi." His second
reservation concerning the identification of the Gratian mentioned in
the Siena necrology as "the Gratian is closely related to his
reservation about Grebner's identification of the Gratian mentioned in
the record of the 1143 Venice court case: neither record accords Gratian
the kind of prominence that might be expected for a figure of such
importance. Gratian appears second on the list of the three legal
consultants in the Venice case, and is not referred to with the
honorific title "*Magister*." And the Siena necrology records nothing
beyond the bare facts of a name, a day (but not year) of death, and that
the defunct had been a bishop from or of Chiusi.

<!--

Pennington claims to be arguing that there was one Gratian, but is
in fact arguing that Gratian composed the *Decretum* incrementally
over the course of a teaching career spanning several decades, which
is not quite the same thing. Also, Pennington does not address
Winroth's content-based arguments in favor of the two-author
hypothesis (e.g., differences between the first and second recensions
in terms of the levels of sophistication in the use of Justinianic
Roman Law).

scholastic theology. See also D. E. Luscombe, “Abelard and the Decretum

[4] Noonan identifies Odofredus as the source for associating Gratian
with Saints Felix and Nabor. Noonan, , 148; but cf. R. W. Southern,
*Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe*, vol. 1 (Oxford, UK
; Cambridge, Mass., USA: Blackwell, 1995), 286n5. Southern draws
attention to an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the
*Decretum*, Bibliothèque publique et universitaire, MS Lat. 60: *Anno
domini MCL a Gratiano S. Feliciani Bononiensis monacho editum*.
Pennington does not identify the manuscript as one known to date from
the twelfth century (see Kenneth Pennington,
[Gratianus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a242),
*Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists*), and
of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript was
produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription as
independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian and
Saints Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible that it
predates Odofredus.

[5] See Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here”, 150-151. Alphonse van Hove,
*Prolegomena ad Codicem iuris canonici*, Editio artera auctior et
emendatior, Commentarium Lovaniense in Codicem iuris canonici, v. 1, t.
1 (Mechlinae: H. Dessain, 1945) had an outsized impact on the trajectory
of medieval canon law studies in twentieth century North America because
of its having been used by the 1964 Yale seminar led by Peter Landau in
the absence of Stephan Kuttner, who was undergoing treatment for cancer
at the time. Seminar participants including Charles Donahue and Robert
Somerville went on to have unusually influential academic careers in the
field (Donahue at Harvard, and Somerville at Columbia where he was
Winroth's dissertation advisor).

[6] "Noonan used sound historical methods, but he chose, as a
distinguished professor of law and later a prominent judge, to couch his
method in lawyerly terms, talking about hearsay and wanting to
cross-examine witnesses. To make any headway with as complex and
difficult a problem as Gratian's biography, it will be important to
cling a bit more closely than Noonan did to classical historical
methodology and terminology, as they have been codified from the late
nineteenth century on." Winroth, “Where Gratian Slept,” August 2013,
106.

[7] R.W. Southern takes an extreme position with respect to Gratian's
teaching career, citing as late as 1995 Gratian's supposed association
with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that he had never been
a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death affirmed that Gratian was a
Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian Order, a small Italian branch of
the Benedictines, which combined austerity of life with considerable
freedom to contribute to the work of the Church in a wide variety of
ways. This is what Gratian did. He engaged in a very un-monastic branch
of study, and produced a law book which became the most widely
distributed and probably most generally used of all the masterpieces of
twelfth-century learning." "the book, and not the teaching of pupils,
was the offering Gratian's monastic life brought to the Church".

304.

There is, however, no reason to assume that the notary who reported on
the proceedings would necessarily have been well-informed about Gratian,
who was, after all, not a local figure in Venice.

[15] Winroth has since come to contextualize the differences between the
first and second recension with respect to the use of Roman law within a
broader context: "The argument about two authors is based on textual
(you could almost say literary) analysis: formulations, practices of
organization, source use, etc. Justinian’s Roman law books is really the
only category of source only used in one of the two recensions. I used
to think that there were other sources, such as 3L, that were only used
in the second recension, but this turned out to be an accident of the
specific sections I used as case studies (C. 24 and C.11 q.3)." (Anders
Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May 2021).

[16] Cite Winroth's dissertation, 345, where he appears open to the
possibility that D.63 d.p.c.34 is an interpolation, without commiting to
it. Winroth ultimately accepted the argument of Rudolf Wiegand (†1998)
that the interpolation hypothesis is a slippery slope---once you start
rejecting problematic passages because they are inconvenient
(chronologically or otherwise), there is no obvious place to stop.

[20] See Larrainzar, “El Borrador de la ’Concordia’ de Graciano”, 601,
for the number of canons in Sg, emphasizing that it is approximate. See
Winroth, *The Making of Gratian’s Decretum*, 2000, 122, for the number
of canons in the first recension. 3,945 is a conventional number.

[22] **Placeholder for Pennington, Larson footnote** Pennington asserts
that "\[t\]he main reason that Winroth created a second 'Gratian' is
because of a text \[D.63 d.p.c.34\] that is found in all pre-Vulgate
manuscripts." Pennington, “The Biography of Gratian, the Father of Canon
Law”, 362. D.63 d.p.c.34 *is* central to Winroth's arguments in favor of
a late date for the first recension (1139), and for a short teaching
career for Gratian, but is not relevant to his argument in favor of the
two-author hypothesis. "The reference to Lateran II only proves that the
*Decretum*, as transmitted by extant manuscripts (and I have checked
several dozens, 'vulgate' as well as 'pre-vulgate'), cannot have been
written before 1139." (Anders Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May
2021). As noted in Chapter 2 and the footnote above, the original basis
for Winroth's two-author hypothesis was that the second recension makes
much more sophisticated use of Roman law concepts and terminology than
the first recension.
