The purpose of this chapter is to examine the closely connected
questions of the authority, author, and authorship of the *Decretum*.[1]

Scholars such as Noonan, Winroth, and Pennington who have investigated
the authorship of the *Decretum* in recent decades have primarily been
interested in the question of who wrote the exact words the text
contains. That emphasis on the attribution of exact words does not
accord well with either medieval definitions of authorship or those
found in current theories of authorship. (Contemporary theories of
literary authorship are ironically closer to medieval theories of
authorship than either are to the definition of authorship tacitly
assumed by most historians, and in some interesting cases draw on late
antique and medieval sources.)

Medieval sources on whom we rely for most of our evidence about who
wrote the *Decretum*, the authors of glosses or of prefaces to
twelfth-century *summae* on the *Decretum*, were not uninterested in the
question of who wrote the exact words in the text. That question however
overlapped for them in a way that it does not for us with the question
of who was the ultimate source of the text's authority. Recent
scholarship sometimes misinterprets twelfth-century statements that are
really about the authority of the author or of the work as instead being
statements about the biography of Gratian or about the authorship of the
*Decretum*. The overlapping questions of the authority, author, and
authorship of the *Decretum* therefore have to be considered carefully,
and where necessary distinctly.

## Authority

In the middle ages, to presume to take on the role of *auctor* was to
make a claim (at least implicitly) to *auctoritas*. Medieval writers
were in general quite reticent about making claims to authority on their
own behalf, and employed a variety of techniques to maintain plausible
deniability that they were in fact claiming authorship and the authority
that went with it. Some repudiated the role of author altogether and
circulated the texts they wrote either anonymously or pseudonymously
under the name of a canonical author of unquestioned authority.
Augustine was the overwhelming favorite, and Gratian extensively quoted
in his *de Penitentia* from a text, *De vera et falsa penitentia*, that
circulated under such false pretences. Others sought to distance
themselves from the role of author by locating authority in texts they
quoted rather than in the original use they made of those quoted texts
in their own writing.[2] Gratian made use of both strategies. He
circulated the *Decretum* anonymously, and made no overt claim for the
authority of his collection other than that derived from the patristic
texts he extracted out of his material sources. In any event, the modern
notion that the ultimate source for the authority of a text is is an
independent judgement by the reader of the validity of the arguments it
contains is simply not applicable to the twelfth century.

<!-- need transition -->

We have already encountered two twelfth-century statements on the
authority, author, and authorship of the *Decretum*. The first was the
gloss inserted in lieu of a title at the beginning of the early Ghent
(Gt), Paris (Pf), and Trier (Tr) manuscripts: "*Concordia discordantium
canonum iuxta determinationem Gratiani episcopi quae in duas partes
principaliter est divisa* (The agreement of disagreeing canons according
to the determination of Bishop Gratian, which is principally divided
into two parts.)"[3] The glossator provides Gratian's name, but advances
at best an ambivalent claim with respect to his authorship of the
*Decretum*. The glossator includes the possibly helpful information that
Gratian had been a bishop. We do not know what basis the glossator had
for making this statement and therefore cannot form a judgement as to
its reliability. The default stance of modern scholarship would be to
understand this as being a statement (whether true or false) about the
biography of Gratian. For that reason, it is the kind of evidence that
must be evaluated with particular care. The teaching authority of the
church is vested in the bishops. To identify Gratian as a bishop is
therefore to make a very specific kind of claim about his authority, and
by extension that of the *Decretum*. Presumably the glossator had some
reason to believe that Gratian had actually been a bishop. The purpose
of communicating that information to the reader however appears to have
been to advance an authority claim on behalf of the collection and its
compiler.

The second of the two twelfth-century statements on the authority,
author, and authorship of the *Decretum* we have already encountered is
found in the preface of Stephen of Tournai to his *Summa* on the
*Decretum*:

> *Compositorem huius operis recte dixerim Gratianum, non auctorem.
> Capitula namque a sanctis patribus edita in hoc volumine composuit,
> i.e. ordinavit. Non eorum auctor vel conditor fuit, nisi forte quis
> eum auctorem idcirco dicere velit, quoniam multa ex parte sua
> sanctorum sententias distinguendo et exponendo in paragraphis suis
> ponit.* (I should properly say that Gratian is the compiler of this
> work, not the author, for he brought together in this volume---that
> is, he arranged---rulings enacted by the holy Fathers. He was not
> their author or framer, unless perchance someone wishes to say that he
> is thus the author since he offered on his own in his dicta many
> things for clarifying and explicating the opinions of the holy
> \[Fathers\].)[4]

Stephen also provides Gratian's name, but specifically denies his
authorship of the *Decretum*, demoting him to to the status of a
*compositor*. Unlike the anonymous glossator, Stephen at least chooses
an active-voice verb to characterize Gratian's creative relationship
with the text of the *Decretum*: Gratian, according to Stephen,
"arranged (*ordinavit*)" the canons. Gratian's role is a distinctly
subordinate one, however, confined to "clarifying and explicating the
opinions of the holy Fathers" whom Stephen centers as the ultimate
source for the authority of the *Decretum*.

Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum* have seen it as a
teaching text, both in the sense that its intended use (or at least one
of its intended uses) was as an introductory textbook, and also in the
sense that it reflected the author's experiences as a classroom teacher.
Gratian's students would appear therefore to have been the potential
witnesses with the best visibility into the authorship of the text of
the *Decretum*. Unfortunately no near-contemporary makes an unambiguous
claim to have been Gratian's student or to have otherwise had first-hand
knowledge of the circumstances under which the *Decretum* was
composed,[5] although three twelfth-century canonist have, with varying
degrees of plausibility, been identified as having been students of
Gratian: Paucapalea (fl. 1140s), Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179),
and Omnebene (d. 1185).

### Paucapalea

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early period of
the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's immediate
footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was "\[a\] pupil of
Gratian and the author of the first commentary on the *Decretum*".[6]
But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea does not refer to
Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis ipsa decreta sunt
materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are the subject matter of the
master producing this work."[7]

The omission is significant. Prefaces to academic books in the twelfth
century formed a recognized genre with well-established conventions. In
an age resistant to any attempt by the human present to appropriate the
authority of the divinely-inspired past, a commentator like Paucapalea
was expected to offer an explicit statement in his preface affirming the
authority of both the work commented on and its author. If Paucapalea
had had something to say about the authority and authorship of Gratian,
his readers would have expected him to do so in his preface. That he did
not suggests that he did not known enough about Gratian to credibly do
so.[8]

<!--

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows
both that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work:
"*In extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine
domini atque baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat,
et in his suum tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the
dedication of churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism,
and also confirmation, and with these things concludes his
treatise."[^p]

[^p]: @paucapalea_summa_1890, 3; @somerville_prefaces_1998, 184-185.

If Rambaud is correct that *de Consecratione* was not part of the
original *Decretum*, the fact that Paucapalea attributed it to the
same unnamed master responsible for rest of the text on which he
was commenting strongly suggests that he did not have direct knowledge
of Gratian or his plan of work.

  -->

### Omnibonus or Omnebene

Omnibonus or Omnebene (d.1185) composed an adaptation or transformation
of the *Decretum* in the 1150s.[9] The basis for the claim that Omnebene
was a student of Gratian is an entry for the year 1130 in the chronicle
of Norman monk Robert of Torigni (†1186)

> *Gratianus episcopus Clusinus coadunavit decreta valde utilia ex
> decretis, canonibus, doctoribus, legibus Romanis, sufficientia ad
> omnes ecclesiasticas causas decidendas, que frequentantur in curia
> Romana et in aliis curiis ecclesiasticis. Hec postmodum abbreviavit
> magister Omnebonum episcopus Veronensis, qui fuerat eius discipulus.*
> (Gratian bishop of Chiusi brought together very useful decrees out of
> decrees, canons, doctors, Roman laws, sufficient for deciding all
> ecclesiastical cases, which are resorted to at the Roman curia and in
> other ecclesiastical courts. Master Omnebonum bishop of Verona, who
> had been his student, afterwards abbreviated them.)[10]

Although the evidence of Robert's chronicle is by Noonan's standard
hearsay, Robert's reputation as a well-informed source concerning
Gratian has improved in recent years since the Siena necrology has made
the identification of Gratian as bishop of Chiusi more probable.

The dates do not preclude Omnebene's having been a student of Gratian.
Although Omnebene lived into the 1180s, the adaptation itself seems to
date from around 1156, perhaps a decade and a half after the end of
whatever teaching career Gratian may have had, and at precisely the
moment that continent-wide interest in the text was increasing most
rapidly.[11]

### Simon of Bisignano

Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179) was the author of a *Summa
decretorum* dated c.1177-79, and a number of glosses on the *Decretum*
are attributed to him.[12] The evidence that Simon of Bisignano was a
student of Gratian's comes from references within his writings.[13]
Simon refers to himself as *discipulus* and to Gratian as *magister* in
at least two places in his *Summa* (**Landau says "frequently"**). There
is, however a hiatus of almost four decades between the latest plausible
date for the end of Gratian's teaching career, and the documentary
evidence we have for Simon's professional career as a canonist. Although
it is not chronologically impossible for Simon to have been Gratian's
student, it seems more likely that he described himself as *discipulus*
in something like the same sense that we might describe contemporary
scholars like Chodorow, Pennington, and Winroth as "students of
Gratian".

<!--

Modern scholars considering the authorship of a text are primarily
interested in the question of whose thought is reflected in the
arguments it makes.

This dissertation is about whether one, two, or many authors wrote
the exact words in the text of the *dicta* in the *Decretum*.

Reserve paragraphs below as conclusion to the Authority section

  -->

The problem of authorship and authority was particularly acute in the
first half of the twelfth century, because early scholastic readers were
more alert to the chinks in the armor of traditional authorities than
their less-sophisticated predecessors had been. Peter Abelard was unique
in the radicalism of his solution to the problem: in *Sic et non*, he
subverted and indeed dissolved the entire notion of authority by showing
that texts written by equally authoritative authors were in actual, not
just apparent, disagreement.

Gratian undertook the conservative hermeneutical project of harmonizing
the apparently discordant canons to the level of sophistication demanded
by a twelfth-century scholastic audience, and accordingly adopted the
strategy of locating authority in the texts that he quoted. It seems,
however, that the widespread reception of the *Decretum* as itself
authoritative benefited from an accidental feature of the text. The page
layout of early manuscripts of the *Decretum*---the placement of
Gratian's *dicta* inline with the authorities rather on the
margins---had the unintentional effect of promoting Gratian himself to
the status of an authority (or at least to a status of near-equality
with his authorities). Even though the specific page layout was probably
adopted in the 1130s or 1140s for no particular reason other than that
the conventions for the various genres of the literature of canon law
had not yet been firmly established, readers in the 1150s and 1160s seem
to have understood it, at least implicitly, as a claim to authority, a
claim that they were more than willing to accept.[14] This was almost
certainly an over-reading of the authority claim actually being made in
the *Decretum*.[15]

## Author

Very little is known about the historical Gratian, and almost everything
that previous generations thought was known about Gratian has proved, on
closer examination, to be myth.[16] On the evidence found in the
*Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been less interested in contemporary
ecclesiastical or secular politics in general, and in the Investiture
Controversy (1076-1122) in particular, than some modern scholars think
he ought to have been. Gratian similarly seems, based on the relatively
limited use he makes in the *Decretum* of material from the *Codex* and
*Digest* of Justinian, to have been either less interested in, or less
well-informed about, the revival of the study of Roman law in the early
twelfth century than we think he ought to have been. On the other hand,
he seems to have been more well-informed about, and more interested in,
the emergence of scholastic theology in northern France than we can
easily explain.[17]

### Noonan

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself is John
T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian slept here: The
changing identity of the father of the systematic study of canon law".
Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating that there is no sound
historical basis for most of the affirmative statements that many
mid-twentieth century handbooks and reference works presented as
commonplace.[18] It is unnecessary to exhaustively catalog all of the
many Gratian myths that Noonan debunked. A single example, his
examination of the history of the claim that Gratian was a Camaldolese
monk at the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna---one of the
most prominent elements of the mythology surrounding Gratian---is
sufficient to illustrate the nature of Noonan's method and conclusions.

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that Gratian
"was staying" (*stabat*) at the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor
while working as a rubricator.[19] Odofredus did not indicate the basis
for his statement that Gratian had been resident at Saints Felix and
Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a monk. In 1758, Camaldolese
scholars Mittarelli and Costadono discovered papal privileges conferred
in 1113 and 1153 identifying Saints Felix and Nabor as Camaldolese, and
inferred from them that the monastery---and by extension Gratian
himself---had been Camaldolese during the intervening years. The claim
that Gratian had a connection to the Camaldolese order attracted
criticism in the eighteenth century, and fell out of favor in the
nineteenth century, before being put back into circulation in the
mid-twentieth century by Van Hove.[20]

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and the
courtroom to the historical record. Noonan relied heavily on the legal
hearsay standard as understood and applied by twentieth-century American
courts of law as the basis for his debunking of much Gratian mythology.
By Noonan's standards, the statement of Odofredus---hearsay, not
attributed to a source, a century after the fact---is nothing more than
legend.

Winroth has questioned whether this is an appropriate standard for
evaluating historical evidence.[21] Noonan's insistence on adhering to
the courtroom rules of evidence can seem like overkill. If, after all,
the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna was in the hands of
Camaldolese communities in 1113 and 1153, it does not seem unreasonable
to infer that it was in the hands of one in the 1120s and 1130s when
Gratian was putatively associated with the foundation, whatever we think
the nature of that association to have been. But Noonan's caution seems
justified when we consider, for example, Southern's having seized upon
the one thinly-sourced datum of the Camaldolese connection as the
foundation for his entire reconstruction of Gratian's intentions and
motivations in undertaking the *Decretum* project, including a
peremptory dismissal of any possibility that Gratian had a teaching
career.[22]

<!--

Noonan briefly discusses an entry in the chronicle of Robert of
Torigny identifying Gratian as bishop of Chiusi. Noonan considers
that claim unverifiable.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 153-154] The
since-discovered Siena necrology makes Robert's identification more
plausible, though by no means certain.

  -->

Noonan's wide-ranging skepticism extended considerably further than this
or that alleged fact about Gratian's biography; he expressed significant
doubt about the assumption that a text like the *Decretum* had a single
author:

> There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to be
> determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three distinctive
> parts, with several distinctive sections within the parts, and these
> parts have undergone editing as to chapter headings, chapter
> insertions, and chapter order. Whatever the later formal ascription,
> is Gratian responsible for all the parts? The other difficulty is the
> range of roles the one 'responsible' person might have had---compiler,
> commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one or all? The
> difficulties relate to each other, because evidence that Gratian was,
> say, the commentator of Part II does not establish what role he had in
> Part I.[23]

Noonan did leave open one affirmative possibility, that a Gratian who
was recorded as having participated in an 1143 case in Venice as one of
three legal consultants ("magister Walfredus", "Gratianus", and
"Moysis", in that order)[24] advising a three-judge panel presided over
by a papal legate, Cardinal Goizo, might be the same Gratian responsible
for the *Decretum*.

> But we can say that it is possible, even plausible, that the unbiased
> notary who recorded the scene at S. Marco is the only person to have
> left an eyewitness account of Gratian.[25]

Noonan concludes that

> we have reason to believe that Gratian composed and commented upon a
> substantial portion of the Concordia. In such composition and
> commentary he revealed himself to be a teacher with theological
> knowledge and interests and a lawyer's point of view. He worked in
> Bologna in the 1130s and 1140s. Beyond these conclusions, we have
> unverified hearsay, palpable legend, and the silent figure in the
> shadows of S. Marco.[26]

This, then, is our starting point. Noonan wrote, however, before
Winroth's discovery of the first recension. Scholarship on the identity
of Gratian in this century has necessarily had to take into account both
Noonan's pruning of his biography and the existence of the first and
second recensions.

### Grebner

One of the earliest attempts to do so was Gundula Grebner's "Lay
patronate in Bologna in the first half of the 12th century: Regular
canons, notaries, and the *Decretum*."[27] Grebner's article is usually
cited in connection with the 1143 court case: "Recently, Gundula Grebner
uncovered more evidence that would confirm Gratian's presence in a
Venetian courtroom and change Noonan's plausible to certain."[28]

<!--

Grebner's prosopographic analysis appears to put Gratian on the
"right" side of the Anacletian schism (i.e., on the same side as
Haimeric with the Innocentians).

  -->

### Winroth

Winroth's arguments in chapters 1-5 of *The Making of Gratian's
Decretum* are agnostic as to whether Gratian 1 is the same person as
Gratian 2.

> "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore chosen
> to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the author of
> the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not intended to
> suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have been the same
> person."[29]

The question of authorial identity is not relevant to the primary
argument that Winroth advances in those chapters, which is that the
Admont, Barcelona, and Florence manuscripts represent a coherent first
recension of the *Decretum* rather than an abbreviation. In chapter 6
and in his conclusion, however, Winroth observes that the second
recension reflects a considerably more sophisticated legal culture than
that reflected in the first recension, notably in the reception of
concepts and terminology from the study of Roman law, and argues that it
is unlikely that one author underwent such an intellectual evolution in
a single generation.[30]

Winroth is strongly committed to a late date (1139) for the first
recension on the grounds that he thinks D.63 d.p.c.34 *must* refer to
canon 28 from the Second Lateran Council of 1139. That first-recension
*dictum* makes a reference to a canon, D.63 c.35, that was later
incorporated into the text of the *Decretum* as D.63 c.35 in the second
recension.[31]

Winroth rejects claims that the Sg manuscript of the *Decretum* is
descended from a version earlier than the first recension, and argues
that it is instead an abbreviation of the first recension with some
interpolations from the second. Winroth therefore does not see the
existence of Sg as a reason to assume either a long teaching career for
Gratian or a long period of incremental development for the text of the
*Decretum*.

Finally, Winroth accepts an entry in a Siena necrology (Siena,
Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati F.I.2, f.5r) brought to scholarly
attention by Francesco Reali as evidence that Gratian the author of the
first recension died as bishop of Chiusi on the feast day of St Lawrence
(August 10) in either 1144 or 1145.[32] The datum provided by the
necrology, recording the death of a "Gratian of Chiusi, bishop",
considered along with an axiomatic assumption of an 1139 date for the
first recension, strengthens the case from Winroth's perspective that
Gratian, having been elevated to a bishopric not long after having
finished work on the first recension, was unlikely to have been the
author of the second recension.

<!--

*This* argument that Gratian could not have been the author of the
second recension is persuasive if and only if you believe *both*
that the first recension was competed not earlier than 1139 *and*
that Gratian was a bishop by 1143 and dead by 1145. It is however
neither the only nor the strongest argument against Gratian's
authorship of the second recension.

  -->

#### Sg

Much of the debate over whether the *Decretum* was the result of a
continuous or discontinuous process of composition focused on the Sankt
Gallen 673 (Sg) manuscript. Pennington and some of his students have
argued that it represented, at some unknown number of removes, an
earlier version of the *Decretum* than Winroth's first recension.
Winroth and Wei have argued that Sg was a relatively uninteresting
abbreviation of a first recension manuscript with some second recension
interpolations.[33]

The version of the *Decretum* preserved in the Sankt Gallen
Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript contains somewhat fewer than 1,050
canons,[34] and is therefore considerably shorter than either the first
recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945) versions of the
text.[35] Formally, Sg is not divided into parts; all of its content is
presented in the form of cases. The first case, however, is unique to
Sg, and is referred to as *Causa Prima* to distinguish it from the
*Causa* I found in all other pre-vulgate and vulgate versions of the
*Decretum*. (*Causa* I appears as *Causa* II in Sg.) It contains a
subset of canons and *dicta* found in Part I, presented in almost
exactly the same order in which they appear in other versions of the
*Decretum*. (There is one relatively minor exception with respect to the
ordering of the texts, the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4,
c.6, and c.7 are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6
and D.31 c.7.)[36] Notably, *Causa Prima* contains no texts (canons or
*dicta*) from the *tractatus de legibus* (distinctions 1-20) and none
from Gratian's "epilogue" (distinctions 81-101).

### Pennington

Pennington builds on Larson's conjecture that the canon referred to at
D.63 d.p.c.34 in the first recension and later incorporated as D.63 c.35
in the second recension is not canon 28 from the Second Lateran Council
(1139), but rather a canon from an earlier council or synod convened by
Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was reissued, a common practice in the
early twelfth century, at Lateran II.[37] Pennington supports Larson's
conjecture by noting that the text of the canon as it appears in the
*Decretum* includes variants (*facta fuerit* vs *fuerit celebrata*, and
*consensus* vs *assensus*) found in none of the twenty manuscript
witnesses to the Lateran II canons edited by Martin Brett.[38]
Pennington argues that there is enough doubt as to whether D.63 d.p.c.34
refers to canon 28 from Lateran II---as opposed to a canon from an
earlier council or synod later reissued with minor textual variations as
canon 28 at Lateran II---that it cannot be used as the sole or primary
basis for imposing a *terminus post quem* of 1139 on the first recension
of the *Decretum*.

Pennington, building on Eichbauer's findings, argues that because the
number of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in both the
margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short of the number that
would be expected if they had been copied from a Vulgate *Decretum* (87
are missing from Aa, and 62 are missing from Fd), these manuscripts
represent an intermediate "next-to-last" stage in the development of the
*Decretum* text intermediate the pre-Vulgate and Vulgate versions.[39]
Furthermore, the fact that the Lateran II canons *are* present in this
"next-to-last" stage undermines the argument going back to Fransen and
supported by Lenherr that the Lateran II canons are a last-minute
addition, and poorly if at all integrated into the argument of the
*Decretum*.[40] **Pennington also cites early manuscripts of the
*Decretum* with 99 and 100 distinctions in Part I as evidence for the
continuous evolution of the text between the first and second
recensions.**

<!--

Pennington assumes an Iberian origin for Bc, but wasn't it originally
Italian?

  -->

Pennington's strongest argument in favor of his position on Sg is not an
abbreviation is that the unique *Causa Prima* (an ordered subset of
canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension of the *Decretum*)
includes neither texts from the *tractatus de legibus* (distinctions
1-20) nor from the "epilogue" (distinctions 81-101). Moreover, four
cases, 24-26 and 28, are missing from Sg entirely. Why, Pennington asks,
would an abbreviator do this?

<!--

The subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension
of the *Decretum* from which *Causa Prima* in the Sg manuscript is
composed is ordered, with the relatively insignificant exception
that the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7
are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653]

  -->

There are two aspects to Pennington's reservations about identifying the
Gratian named in the Siena necrology with the author of the *Decretum*.
Pennington is open to the possibility that the author of the *Decretum*
eventually became a bishop somewhere, but questions whether the person
named in the necrology was either the bishop of Chiusi, or the author of
the *Decretum*. He notes that the necrology refers to "Gratian of
Chiusi, bishop", not to "Gratian, bishop of Chiusi." His second
reservation concerning the identification of the Gratian mentioned in
the Siena necrology as "the Gratian is closely related to his
reservation about Grebner's identification of the Gratian mentioned in
the record of the 1143 Venice court case: neither record accords Gratian
the kind of prominence that might be expected for a figure of such
importance. Gratian appears second on the list of the three legal
consultants in the Venice case, and is not referred to with the
honorific title "*Magister*." And the Siena necrology records nothing
beyond the bare facts of a name, a day (but not year) of death, and that
the defunct had been a bishop from or of Chiusi.

<!--

Pennington claims to be arguing that there was one Gratian, but is
in fact arguing that Gratian composed the *Decretum* incrementally
over the course of a teaching career spanning several decades, which
is not quite the same thing. Also, Pennington does not address
Winroth's content-based arguments in favor of the two-author
hypothesis (e.g., differences between the first and second recensions
in terms of the levels of sophistication in the use of Justinianic
Roman Law).

  -->

## Authorship

Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around the
figure of the author.[41] Three examples from classical and late
antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which this requirement could
be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary ambitions with the support
of highly skilled but unfree labor purchased out of his personal wealth,
most famously his slave and later freedman Tiro. A wealthy lay patron
named Ambrose paid for the secretarial staff that supported the
authorial activities of Origen of Alexandria (†253).[42] Quasi-monastic
members of the episcopal household of Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided
the scribal support that made his prodigious authorial output possible.
The mode of production pioneered by Augustine and his household in which
monastic labor enabled the creation of original texts by their authors
as well as the subsequent copying and circulation of finished texts
proved a durable one, and predominated in the Latin West until the
thirteenth century.[43]

Given the material and social technologies for authorship available in
the twelfth century, creation of a text the size of Gratian's *Decretum*
would necessarily have been a collaborative effort. Pennington has noted
that "Gratian may have had an atelier of assistants,"[44] but that
observation suggests that the nature of the collaboration between
Gratian and those Pennington conceives of as his assistant needs to be
examined more closely. What substantive intellectual contributions, if
any, did Gratian's collaborators make to the project?[45] There are a
number of indications, discussed in the previous chapter, that the
*Decretum* outgrew the ability of a single author to effectively manage
the development of the text. The question is whether Gratian's partial
loss of control of the project opened up a space for genuinely
collaborative authorship. The starting point for this inquiry is a
theoretically informed understanding of what authorship is.

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Grebner, Winroth, and
Pennington[46] reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes that if
we can identify the historical Gratian, we will have identified the
author of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of the first
recension), with authorship of the text understood in a way not unlike
the way in which we might understand the authorship of a modern literary
text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept of authorship, allowing
for the possibility that there might have been multiple authors.) In
conducting this kind of "quest of the historical Gratian," historians
have uncritically accepted a conceptualization of authorship that is
somewhat anachronistic when applied to a medieval text and has been
largely discarded by literary scholarship over the last half-century.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death of the Author" and Michel
Foucault's 1969 response "What Is an Author?" are foundational readings
in the theory of authorship.[47]

### Barthes

"The Death of the Author" holds a place in literary studies somewhat
similar to the place that Noonan's "Gratian Slept Here" holds in canon
law studies---it is a clearing of the ground of older ways of thinking
in the field. Although the title of the essay was a lightning-rod in
1980s theory war polemics, taken as if Barthes were arguing that texts
somehow wrote themselves, Medievalists will recognize the French title
of the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*.
Barthes's essay is short and relatively free of arcane technical terms.
Barthes was a literary critic and scholar making an argument to other
literary critics and scholars against the practice of close-reading
literary texts with the focus on the biographical and historical context
of the author and its relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the term "Author" to indicate the conceptualization of
authorship he is arguing against and the term "author" where he intends
to use the word in its more general and non-technical sense. An Author
is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a literary text, and
"is in the same relation of antecedence to his work as a father to his
child."[48] Barthes argues that authors cannot be Authors---no person or
persons can have a parent-child relationship to a text since all
literary texts are socially constructed: "The text is a tissue of
quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture."[49]

**Gratian may be the author of the *dicta* but he is not their Author.
The *dicta* are socially constructed "tissue\[s\] of quotations drawn
from the innumerable centres of culture."**

The Barthes's central argument is against precisely the kind of reading
that is prevalent in scholarship on Gratian and the *Decretum*:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish
> it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a conception
> suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting itself the
> important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases: society,
> history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author has been
> found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.[50]

Barthes uses the term "scriptor" to indicate an alternative
conceptualization of authorship in which the performative aspect of the
author's act is the central focus. Barthes uses the terms "criticism"
and "critic" to refer respectively to the activity of close-reading a
literary text and one engaging in that activity. Translating the terms
as "reading" and "reader" would not be seriously misleading. Gratian as
author of the *dicta* is therefore, using Barthes's definitions, both
scriptor and critic. The *dicta* were originally delivered in a
classroom setting, and thus have both a performative and a
contemporaneous aspect ("there is no other time than that of the
enunciation and every text is eternally written *here* and *now*")[51]
The *dicta* are also the record of a particular close-reading of a
selection of authoritative texts.

### Foucault

Barthes's criticism of the idea of authorship is apophatic, concerned
mostly with what, in his view, authorship is not. Barthes warns against
the conceptualization of authorship, centered on the
biographical-historical context of the individual author, that most
historians (including those who have written about Gratian's authorship
of the *Decretum*) take for granted. In place of the conceptualization
of authorship rendered suspect by Barthes, Foucault proposes the idea of
the "author function." He starts by asking "\[w\]hat is an author’s
name? How does it function?"[52] and then goes on to observe:

> ... if we proved that Shakespeare did not write those sonnets which
> pass for his, that would constitute a significant change and affect
> the manner in which the author's name functions. If we proved that
> Shakespeare wrote Bacon's *Organon* by showing that the same author
> wrote both the works of Bacon and those of Shakespeare, that would ...
> entirely modify the functioning of the author's name.[53]

Foucault has a reputation for using esoteric vocabulary in his
writing---his critics would say jargon---in a way that many historians
find objectionable. The technical use of the term "author function" is a
case in point. The idea that he is attempting to convey, however, is
relatively straightforward. Abstract away the biographical details about
the author from the work that the *idea* of the author does for us when
we read a text, and what remains is the author function. Ironically,
given the rather avant-garde reputation that is still attached to his
name at least in the English-speaking world, Foucault derives the
substantive content of the idea of the author function almost entirely
from Jerome (†420).

> In *De Viris illustribus*, Saint Jerome explains that homonymy is not
> sufficient to identify legitimately authors of more than one work ...
> The name as an individual trademark is not enough when one works
> within a textual tradition.[54]

This is significant. We face in the *Decretum* a problem concerning
authorship that medieval textual scholars like Abelard and Gratian
himself would have found quite familiar: a textual tradition to which
the name of Gratian became attached quite early on "as an individual
trademark." Furthermore, modern theories of literary authorship are
substantially derived from the work of the figure that Gratian's
twelfth-century contemporaries, most notably Abelard, considered
supremely authoritative on precisely this kind of problem.[55]

> How, then can one attribute several discourses to one and the same
> author? How can one use the author function to determine if one is
> dealing with one or several individuals? Saint Jerome proposes four
> criteria:[56]

Only two of Jerome's four criteria (the second and fourth) have figured
significantly in recent scholarship on the authorship of Gratian's
*Decretum*.

> \(1\) if among several books attributed to an author one is inferior
> to the others, it must be withdrawn from the list of the author's
> works (the author is therefore defined as a constant level of value);

> \(2\) the same should be done if certain texts contradict the doctrine
> expounded in the author’s other works (the author is thus defined as a
> field of conceptual or theoretical coherence);

Winroth argues that the second recension of the *Decretum* reflects a
level of reception of Roman Law doctrine so much more advanced than the
first recension that the two recensions cannot be attributed to a single
author.

> \(3\) one must also exclude works that are written in a different
> style, containing words and expressions not ordinarily found in the
> writer’s production;

> \(4\) finally, passages quoting statements made or mentioning events
> that occurred after the author's death must be regarded as
> interpolated texts (the author is seen as a historical figure at the
> crossroads of a certain number of events).[57]

Foucault's essay is a response to Barthes's.

Foucault's essay is more directly relevant than Barthes's to the
problems of authorship raised by Gratian's *Decretum*,

[1] The purpose of the first (Authority) section of this chapter is to
show, more than tell, that most of the medieval statements that modern
historians take to be evidence about the biography of the author or the
authorship of the text are really statements about the *authority* of
either Gratian or the *Decretum*.

You summarized the purpose of the second (Author) section of this
chapter---which at the time we took to *be* the chapter---thusly:

"The third order of business then is to recount the history of efforts,
from the *Summa Parisiensis* on, of legal scholars and historians to
find the man behind the name Gratian. Here, you need to lay out the
traditional evidence used for solving this puzzle. You are lucky that
Noonan, Pennington etc. have laid out the evidence and played with it
for you." – Stan Chodorow

Is the *Summa Parisiensis* just an example, or is there something
particularly significant about the evidence it provides regarding
Gratian and the *Decretum* that I need to specifically address?

claimed to have been taught by him." (R. W. Southern, *Scholastic

[14] "In the first recension, Gratian I both collected authoritative
texts and commented upon them, as did Peter Lombard in his roughly
contemporary *Sentences*. Both texts were written to meet the need for a
basic text-book in the teaching of their respective disciplines. Other
fields, such as Roman law, medicine, and biblical studies, already
possessed authoritative texts which could serve as the basis for the
teacher's commentary and interpretation. Gratian I and the Lombard were
in effect forced to create their own authoritative texts (their
authority deriving from the fact that they consisted mainly of
quotations) to be able effectively to teach their subjects. When they
did this, they had no reason to separate text from commentary. They
could not have suspected that their texts would become standard
school-texts, nor did they know that it later would become common to
keep text and commentary separate. Could they ever have guessed how
great the growth of their subjects would be after their deaths? In their
works, we can observe teachers creating tools for their own teaching
when there were as yet no standard forms for academic texts in their
subjects. The development of glosses, *summae*, *questiones*,
*distinctiones*, etc., came later, as did the awareness of teachers like
Bernard of Pavia that their compilations might become standard
school-texts (and, hence, that comments were best relegated to the
margins)." Winroth, *The Making of Gratian’s Decretum*, 2000, 191.

[15] At most, there seems to have been a limited claim of authority
being made by the authors of the first-recension *dicta* (Gratian 1) on
behalf of their *magister*, the author of the case statements (Gratian
0), whose harmonization of the canons was authoritative for them.

[16] Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here.”

[17] See Stephan Kuttner, “The Father of the Science of Canon Law,”
*Jurist* 1 (1941): 2–19. Kuttner argues that Gratian applied Ivo's
program as it had been developed in the intervening forty years by
scholastic theology, most notably by Abelard, and not in its original
form: scholastic theology got the program from Ivo, Gratian got it from
scholastic theology. See also D. E. Luscombe, “Abelard and the Decretum
of Gratian.” in *The School of Peter Abelard: The Influence of Abelard’s
Thought in the Early Scholastic Period*, Cambridge Studies in Medieval
Life and Thought, new series, v. 14 (London: Cambridge U.P, 1969),
214–23; and Anders Winroth, “Where Gratian Slept: The Life and Death of
the Father of Canon Law,” *Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung für
Rechtsgeschichte: Kanonistische Abteilung* 99, no. 1 (August 2013):
105–28, 111.

[18] Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here.”

[19] Noonan identifies Odofredus as the source for associating Gratian
with Saints Felix and Nabor. Noonan, , 148; but cf. Southern,
*Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe*, 286n5. Southern
draws attention to an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the
*Decretum*, Bibliothèque publique et universitaire, MS Lat. 60: *Anno
domini MCL a Gratiano S. Feliciani Bononiensis monacho editum*.
Pennington does not identify the manuscript as one known to date from
the twelfth century (see Kenneth Pennington,
[Gratianus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a242),
*Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists*), and
of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript was
produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription as
independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian and
Saints Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible that it
predates Odofredus.

[20] See Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here”, 150-151. Alphonse van Hove,
*Prolegomena ad Codicem iuris canonici*, Editio artera auctior et
emendatior, Commentarium Lovaniense in Codicem iuris canonici, v. 1, t.
1 (Mechlinae: H. Dessain, 1945) had an outsized impact on the trajectory
of medieval canon law studies in twentieth century North America because
of its having been used by the 1964 Yale seminar led by Peter Landau in
the absence of Stephan Kuttner, who was undergoing treatment for cancer
at the time. Seminar participants including Charles Donahue and Robert
Somerville went on to have unusually influential academic careers in the
field (Donahue at Harvard, and Somerville at Columbia where he was
Winroth's dissertation advisor).

[21] "Noonan used sound historical methods, but he chose, as a
distinguished professor of law and later a prominent judge, to couch his
method in lawyerly terms, talking about hearsay and wanting to
cross-examine witnesses. To make any headway with as complex and
difficult a problem as Gratian's biography, it will be important to
cling a bit more closely than Noonan did to classical historical
methodology and terminology, as they have been codified from the late
nineteenth century on." Winroth, “Where Gratian Slept,” August 2013,
106.

[22] R.W. Southern takes an extreme position with respect to Gratian's
teaching career, citing as late as 1995 Gratian's supposed association
with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that he had never been
a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death affirmed that Gratian was a
Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian Order, a small Italian branch of
the Benedictines, which combined austerity of life with considerable
freedom to contribute to the work of the Church in a wide variety of
ways. This is what Gratian did. He engaged in a very un-monastic branch
of study, and produced a law book which became the most widely
distributed and probably most generally used of all the masterpieces of
twelfth-century learning." "the book, and not the teaching of pupils,
was the offering Gratian's monastic life brought to the Church".

[24] Pennington reads a great deal into the order (why wasn't Gratian
referred to first?) and the honorifics (why wasn't Gratian referred to
as "Magister"?). Pennington, “The Biography of Gratian, the Father of
Canon Law”, 387-388. There is, however, no reason to assume that the
notary who reported on the proceedings would necessarily have been
well-informed about Gratian, who was, after all, not a local figure in
Venice.

[29] Winroth, *The Making of Gratian’s Decretum*, 2000, 122.

[30] Winroth has since come to contextualize the differences between the
first and second recension with respect to the use of Roman law within a
broader context: "The argument about two authors is based on textual
(you could almost say literary) analysis: formulations, practices of
organization, source use, etc. Justinian’s Roman law books is really the
only category of source only used in one of the two recensions. I used
to think that there were other sources, such as 3L, that were only used
in the second recension, but this turned out to be an accident of the
specific sections I used as case studies (C. 24 and C.11 q.3)." (Anders
Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May 2021).

[31] Cite Winroth's dissertation, 345, where he appears open to the
possibility that D.63 d.p.c.34 is an interpolation, without commiting to
it. Winroth ultimately accepted the argument of Rudolf Wiegand (†1998)
that the interpolation hypothesis is a slippery slope---once you start
rejecting problematic passages because they are inconvenient
(chronologically or otherwise), there is no obvious place to stop.

expands on a presentation given by Winroth at the Fourteenth
International Congress of Medieval Canon Law, Toronto, 2012.

[34] Carlos Larrainzar describes Sg as having "poco menos de 1,050
*auctoritates* y en torno a los 650 *dicta*." Carlos Larrainzar, “El

MS 673 (=Sg),” *Ius Ecclesiae: Rivista Internazionale di Diritto
Canonico* 11, no. 3 (1999): 593–666, 601. "The second recension contains
3,945 canons (including the paleae) in the editions. The first recension
contains only 1,860 canons (47 percent)." Winroth, *The Making of
Gratian’s Decretum*, 2000, 122.

[35] See Larrainzar, “El Borrador de la ’Concordia’ de Graciano”, 601,
for the number of canons in Sg, emphasizing that it is approximate. See
Winroth, *The Making of Gratian’s Decretum*, 2000, 122, for the number
of canons in the first recension. 3,945 is a conventional number.

[37] **Placeholder for Pennington, Larson footnote** Pennington asserts
that "\[t\]he main reason that Winroth created a second 'Gratian' is
because of a text \[D.63 d.p.c.34\] that is found in all pre-Vulgate
manuscripts." Pennington, “The Biography of Gratian, the Father of Canon
Law”, 362. D.63 d.p.c.34 *is* central to Winroth's arguments in favor of
a late date for the first recension (1139), and for a short teaching
career for Gratian, but is not relevant to his argument in favor of the
two-author hypothesis. "The reference to Lateran II only proves that the
*Decretum*, as transmitted by extant manuscripts (and I have checked
several dozens, 'vulgate' as well as 'pre-vulgate'), cannot have been
written before 1139." (Anders Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May
2021). As noted in Chapter 2 and the footnote above, the original basis
for Winroth's two-author hypothesis was that the second recension makes
much more sophisticated use of Roman law concepts and terminology than
the first recension.

[43] Monastic modes of text production were gradually replaced by
commercial modes of production, e.g., around the University of Paris.

Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris 1200-1500.*

[44] Pennington, “The Biography of Gratian, the Father of Canon Law,”

[45] The quasi-monastic model of text production leaves open a range of
possibilities. Those who have read the *Vita Augustini* written by
Possidius of Calama († c.437) are likely to be unimpressed by the
intellectual caliber of Augustine's episcopal household, and to assess
its contribution to his work accordingly.

[55] "We must also be very careful not to be deceived by a false
attribution of authorship or by a corrupt text ... Jerome, that most
reliable writer and most faithful translator, has given us forewarning
of this." Peter Abelard, “Prologue to the Yes and No,” in *Medieval
Literary Theory and Criticism, c.1100-c.1375: The Commentary Tradition*,
ed. A. J. Minnis, A. Brian Scott, and David Wallace (Oxford: Clarendon

[56] Foucault, “What Is an Author?”, 214. Foucault claims to have
derived the four criteria for determining whether a given "discursive
set" has one or several authors from Jerome's *De Viris illustribus*. He
provides, however, no citations. Walzer and Inabinit indicate that
"similar principles" can be found in Karl Kelchner Hulley, “Principles
of Textual Criticism Known to St. Jerome,” *Harvard Studies in Classical
Philology* 55 (1944): 87–109, 105-109. Arthur E. Walzer and Brandon M.
Inabinet, “Who Wrote the Rhetoric? A Response to Brad McAdon,” *Advances
in the History of Rhetoric* 14, no. 2 (July 2011): 166–90, 188. The
section of Hulley's article on "various points pertinent to questions of
authorship" is in fact almost certainly the ultimate source for
Foucault's four criteria, and provides citations to many works by Jerome
(not just *De Viris illustribus*) relevant to the question of
determining the authorship of a text or texts.
