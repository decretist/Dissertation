### Gratian's teaching career

Evidence concerning Gratian's career as a teacher of canon law is
contradictory. On the one hand, the early manuscript tradition for
the *Decretum* displays enough variation, even among the first-recension
manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P, to suggest that the text developed
continuously over the span of, and in parallel with, a relatively
long teaching career---perhaps a decade or more. On the other hand,
Gratian's personal obscurity is so profound---Stephan Kuttner
compared Gratian to the anonymous builders of Gothic cathedrals[^d25]---as
to suggest a short, or even no, teaching career.[^d26]

Considering the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the
author of the foundational textbook for the study of canon law in
the classical period, one of the truly stellar intellectual
achievements of the renaissance of the twelfth century, his complete
absence from the kinds of academic genealogies and origin stories
that Odofredus (†1265) handed down to his own Roman law students
is striking indeed.[^d27]

We might be better able to assess Gratian's teaching career and how
it influenced the compilation and transmission of the *Decretum*
were we in a position to positively identify at least a few of his
students. Here again, however, the evidence is mixed at best.

### Epilogue

By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the systematic study
of canon law had evolved in a direction of which its father Gratian
would probably not have approved, and which he may even have had
difficulty recognizing as the same practical or applied branch of
theology his own work presupposed it to be. After around 1190, the
attention of both academic and practicing canonists decisively
turned away from theological jurisprudence in the tradition of
Gratian, based on a rich collection of scriptural, patristic,
conciliar, and papal source texts, and towards a much more narrowly
circumscribed technical jurisprudence focused exclusively on
contemporary papal decretals.

[^d25]: "He is one of those deeply admirable men of pious modesty,
like the builders of the medieval cathedrals, whose person is hidden
and effaced completely behind their immortal works." [@kuttner_father_1941,
4].

[^d26]: **Winroth argues for a short teaching career, Southern
argues for no teaching career.**

[^d27]: **Expand:** The tradition of Roman law teaching in Bologna
preserved an elaborate genealogy of masters and their students:
Pepo preceded Wernerius [Irnerius], who taught the Four Doctors.
Odofredus is an important source for this tradition, and his remarks
about Irnerius can be found in his commentary on *Dig.* 1.1.6.
Odofredus, *Lectura super Digesto veteri*, (2 volumes, Lyon:
1550-1552; repr. Bologna 1967-1968). For a short excerpt from the
Latin text with accompanying English translation, see
[@radding_origins_1988, 159-160] **See also Pennington "Big Bang".**
Note that Odofredus is also the source for associating Gratian with
the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor. [@noonan_gratian_1979,
148].

    <CAVSA XXVII> <Q.II> § *Sequitur secunda questio* Sacram et
    authenticam pie recordationis Gratianus de matrimonio distinctionem
    composuit, quam quidam inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem
    et simplicium potibus inuidentes more seuorum animalium aquas
    limpidas turbauerunt. Gratianus uero, canonum habita notitia
    et mente perspecta, dixit inter sponsum et sponsam esse
    matrimonium, sed initiatum; inter uirum et uxorem consummatum.
    Sed quoniam non est discipulus super magistrum nec debet securis
    contra eum qui secat gloriari timemus os nostrum in celum mittere
    et eum reprehendere cuius non sumus digni soluere corrigiam
    calceamenti.

    Note that the phrase "sed inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem"
    also occurs in Rufinus's treatment of the same question, C.27
    q.2. [@rufinus_summa_1963, 440].

    Gratian of pious remembrance composed a sacred and *authenticam*
    distinction concerning marriage, *quam quidam inanis glorie
    aucupes fecere bifrontem* and not seeing with the drinks of the
    simple, [they] troubled clear waters in the manner of *seuorum*
    animals. But Gratian *habita notitia* of the canon and *mente
    perspecta*, said that matrimony is between spouse and spouse,
    but having been consecrated (*initiatum*), is consummated between
    husband and wife. But since the disciple is not above his master
    (Matthew 10:24, Luke 6:40), and the axe (*securis*) ought not
    boast (*gloriari*) against him who cuts (*secat*) (Isaiah 10:15),
    we fear to send our mouth into heaven (Psalm 72:9?) and to find
    fault with him the string (*corrigiam*) of whose shoes we are
    not worthy to loosen (John 1:27) (PLE).

    <DISTINCTIO IIII> 31. *Solet queri* Quod quamuis Magister noster
    docuerit, nos tamen in hoc nolumus eum imitari.

    Although our master taught that, we nevertheless do not wish
    to imitate him in this (PLE).
