subtitle: Authority, Author, Authorship
---
The purpose of this chapter is to examine the closely connected
questions of the authority, author, and authorship of the *Decretum*.[^1]

Scholars such as Noonan, Winroth, and Pennington who have investigated
the authorship of the *Decretum* in recent decades have primarily
been interested in the question of who wrote the exact words the
text contains. That emphasis on the attribution of exact words does
not accord well with either medieval definitions of authorship or
those found in current theories of authorship. (Contemporary theories
of literary authorship are ironically closer to medieval theories
of authorship than either are to the definition of authorship tacitly
assumed by most historians, and in some interesting cases draw on
late antique and medieval sources.)

Medieval sources on whom we rely for most of our evidence about who
wrote the *Decretum*, the authors of glosses or of prefaces to
twelfth-century *summae* on the *Decretum*, were not uninterested
in the question of who wrote the exact words in the text. That
question however overlapped for them in a way that it does not for
us with the question of who was the ultimate source of the text's
authority. Recent scholarship sometimes misinterprets twelfth-century
statements that are really about the authority of the author or of
the work as instead being statements about the biography of Gratian
or about the authorship of the *Decretum*. The overlapping questions
of the authority, author, and authorship of the *Decretum* therefore
have to be considered carefully, and where necessary distinctly.

## Authority

In the middle ages, to presume to take on the role of *auctor* was
to make a claim (at least implicitly) to *auctoritas*. Medieval
writers were in general quite reticent about making claims to
authority on their own behalf, and employed a variety of techniques
to maintain plausible deniability that they were in fact claiming
authorship and the authority that went with it. Some repudiated the
role of author altogether and circulated the texts they wrote either
anonymously or pseudonymously under the name of a canonical author
of unquestioned authority. Augustine was the overwhelming favorite,
and Gratian extensively quoted in his *de Penitentia* from a text,
*De vera et falsa penitentia*, that circulated under such false
pretences. Others sought to distance themselves from the role of
author by locating authority in texts they quoted rather than in
the original use they made of those quoted texts in their own
writing.[^2] Gratian made use of both strategies. He circulated the
*Decretum* anonymously, and made no overt claim for the authority
of his collection other than that derived from the patristic texts
he extracted out of his material sources. In any event, the modern
notion that the ultimate source for the authority of a text is the
independent judgement passed by a reader on the validity of the
arguments it contains is simply not applicable to the twelfth
century.

We have already encountered two twelfth-century statements on the
authority, author, and authorship of the *Decretum*. The first was
the gloss inserted in lieu of a title at the beginning of the early
Ghent (Gt), Paris (Pf), and Trier (Tr) manuscripts: "*Concordia
discordantium canonum iuxta determinationem Gratiani episcopi quae
in duas partes principaliter est divisa* (The agreement of disagreeing
canons according to the determination of Bishop Gratian, which is
principally divided into two parts.)"[^3] The glossator provides
Gratian's name, but advances at best an ambivalent claim with respect
to his authorship of the *Decretum*. The glossator includes the
possibly helpful information that Gratian had been a bishop. We do
not know what basis the glossator had for making this statement and
therefore cannot form a judgement as to its reliability. The default
stance of modern scholarship would be to understand this as being
a statement (whether true or false) about the biography of Gratian.
It is however the kind of evidence that must be evaluated with
particular care. The teaching authority of the church is vested in
the bishops. To identify Gratian as a bishop is therefore to make
a very specific kind of claim about his authority, and by extension
that of the *Decretum*. Presumably the glossator had some reason
to believe that Gratian had actually been a bishop. The purpose of
communicating that information to the reader however appears to
have been to advance an authority claim on behalf of the collection
and its compiler.

The second of the two twelfth-century statements on the authority,
author, and authorship of the *Decretum* we have already encountered
is found in the preface of Stephen of Tournai to his *Summa* on the
*Decretum*:

> *Compositorem huius operis recte dixerim Gratianum, non auctorem.
Capitula namque a sanctis patribus edita in hoc volumine composuit,
i.e. ordinavit. Non eorum auctor vel conditor fuit, nisi forte quis
eum auctorem idcirco dicere velit, quoniam multa ex parte sua
sanctorum sententias distinguendo et exponendo in paragraphis suis
ponit.* (I should properly say that Gratian is the compiler of this
work, not the author, for he brought together in this volume---that
is, he arranged---rulings enacted by the holy Fathers. He was not
their author or framer, unless perchance someone wishes to say that
he is thus the author since he offered on his own in his dicta many
things for clarifying and explicating the opinions of the holy
[Fathers].)[^4]

Stephen also provides Gratian's name, but specifically denies his
authorship of the *Decretum*, demoting him to to the status of a
*compositor*. Unlike the anonymous glossator, Stephen at least
chooses an active-voice verb to characterize Gratian's creative
relationship with the text of the *Decretum*: Gratian, according
to Stephen, "arranged (*ordinavit*)" the canons. Gratian's role is
a distinctly subordinate one, however, confined to "clarifying and
explicating the opinions of the holy Fathers" to whom Stephen looks
as the ultimate source for the authority of the *Decretum*.

Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum* have seen it as
a teaching text, both in the sense that its intended use (or at
least one of its intended uses) was as an introductory textbook,
and also in the sense that it reflected the author's experiences
as a classroom teacher. The early manuscript tradition for the
*Decretum* displays enough variation, even among the first-recension
Admont (Aa), Barcelona (Bc), Florence (Fd), and Paris (P) manuscripts,
to suggest that the text developed continuously over the span of,
and in parallel with, a relatively long teaching career---perhaps
a decade or more. Gratian's students would therefore appear to have
been the potential witnesses with the best visibility into the
authorship of the text of the *Decretum* over the course of the
1130s and possibly as early as the 1120s. Unfortunately no
near-contemporary makes an unambiguous claim to have been Gratian's
student or to have otherwise had first-hand knowledge of the
circumstances under which the *Decretum* was composed.[^5] Considering
the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the author of the
foundational textbook for the study of canon law in the classical
period, his complete absence from the kinds of academic genealogies
and origin stories that Odofredus (†1265) handed down to his own
Roman law students is striking indeed.[^6] Three twelfth-century
canonist have, however, with varying degrees of plausibility, been
identified as having been students of Gratian: Paucapalea (fl.
1140s), Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179), and Omnebene (d. 1185).

<!--

What we'd really like to have is evidence from one or more of his
students about the biography of Gratian and about the authorship
of the *Decretum*. The *Decretum* was a teaching text, and Gratian's
students had a front-row seat to its development. Unfortunately,
"the usual suspects" are all silent, strongly suggesting we have
the wrong "usual suspects," i.e. they (Paucapalea, Omnebene, and
Simon, etc.) were not actually Gratian's students. We don't appear
to have anything from Gratian's actual students. If we want the
*ipsissima verba* of Gratian's actual students, we probably have
to look between the covers of the *Decretum* to find them.

  -->

### Paucapalea

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early
period of the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's
immediate footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was
"[a] pupil of Gratian and the author of the first commentary on
the *Decretum*".[^7] But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea
does not refer to Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis
ipsa decreta sunt materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are
the subject matter of the master producing this work."[^8]

The omission is significant. Prefaces to academic books in the
twelfth century formed a recognized genre with well-established
conventions. In an age resistant to any attempt by the human present
to appropriate the authority of the divinely-inspired past, a
commentator like Paucapalea was expected to offer an explicit
statement in his preface affirming the authority of both the work
commented on and its author. If Paucapalea had had something to say
about the authority and authorship of Gratian, his readers would
have expected him to do so in his preface. That he did not suggests
that he did not known enough about Gratian to credibly do so.[^9]

<!--

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows
both that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work:
"*In extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine
domini atque baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat,
et in his suum tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the
dedication of churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism,
and also confirmation, and with these things concludes his
treatise."[^p]

[^p]: @paucapalea_summa_1890, 3; @somerville_prefaces_1998, 184-185.

If Rambaud is correct that *de Consecratione* was not part of the
original *Decretum*, the fact that Paucapalea attributed it to the
same unnamed master responsible for rest of the text on which he
was commenting strongly suggests that he did not have direct knowledge
of Gratian or his plan of work.

  -->

### Omnibonus or Omnebene

Omnibonus or Omnebene (d.1185) composed an adaptation or transformation
of the *Decretum* in the 1150s.[^10] The dates do not preclude
Omnebene's having been a student of Gratian. Although Omnebene lived
into the 1180s, the adaptation itself seems to date from around
1156, perhaps a decade and a half after the end of whatever teaching
career Gratian may have had, and at precisely the moment that
continent-wide interest in the text was increasing most rapidly.[^11]
The basis for the claim that Omnebene was a student of Gratian is
an entry for the year 1130 in the chronicle of Norman monk Robert
of Torigni (†1186)

> *Gratianus episcopus Clusinus coadunavit decreta valde utilia ex
decretis, canonibus, doctoribus, legibus Romanis, sufficientia ad
omnes ecclesiasticas causas decidendas, que frequentantur in curia
Romana et in aliis curiis ecclesiasticis. Hec postmodum abbreviavit
magister Omnebonum episcopus Veronensis, qui fuerat eius discipulus.*
(Gratian bishop of Chiusi brought together very useful decrees out
of decrees, canons, doctors, Roman laws, sufficient for deciding
all ecclesiastical cases, which are resorted to at the Roman curia
and in other ecclesiastical courts. Master Omnebonum bishop of
Verona, who had been his student, afterwards abbreviated them.)[^12]

Robert's brief chronicle entry contains six distinct factual
assertions: i) that Gratian was bishop of Chiusi, ii) that he
"brought together the decrees" (*coadunavit decreta*) in a form
useful to, and widely used by, ecclesiastical courts, iii) that he
did so around 1130, iv) that Omnebene was bishop of Verona, v) that
he abbreviated the *Decretum*, and vi) that he had been Gratian's
student.[^13] Three of these factual assertions are uncontroversial:
that Gratian "brought together" the *Decretum*, that Omnebene
abbreviated it, and that Omnebene was bishop of Verona.

Those scholars who interpret the discovery of the first-recension
manuscripts as evidence that Gratian's work on the *Decretum*
extended over a decade or more---Pennington and Larson, but not
Winroth---have come to see Robert's 1130 date as more plausible
than it had previously been thought to be.[@larson_early_2007,
54-55] Other scholars who accept a twelfth-century reference to a
"Gratian of Chiusi, bishop" in a Siena necrology as referring to
the Gratian associated with the *Decretum*---Winroth, but not
Pennington---have come to see Robert's claim that Gratian was the
bishop of Chiusi as more plausible than it had previously been
thought to be. The result is that Robert's overall reputation as a
well-informed source concerning Gratian has improved in this century
without there necessarily being much agreement as to whether the
claim that Gratian was working on the *Decretum* around 1130 or
that he was bishop of Chiusi ought to be considered more credible
in light of the newly available evidence.

The best place to look for first-hand evidence from Omnebene about
Gratian and whether he had been Gratian's student, as well as the
circumstances under which the *Decretum* was composed, would be in
a preface to his abbreviation. Unfortunately, there is no printed
edition of the abbreviation, and the only form in which a manuscript
of the abbreviation was available was a low-resolution digitization
of an old microfilm of Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France,
Latin 3886. It does not appear to have a preface of any kind, but
launches immediately into the abbreviation starting with "*Humanum
genus duobus regitur*." In the apparent absence then of any first-hand
evidence from Omnebene himself, we have only Robert's word that
Omnebene was Gratian's student, and so, like Noonan, "[w]e are left
to speculate as to how sound his story was."[@noonan_gratian_1979,
153-154] In the end, there may be little more informational content
to be extracted from the statement than that Robert understood
Omnebene to be working within a specific intellectual tradition of
which Gratian was, by that time, the acknowledged founder.

### Simon of Bisignano

Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179) was the author of a *Summa
decretorum* dated c.1177-79, and a number of glosses on the *Decretum*
are attributed to him.[^16] The evidence that Simon of Bisignano
was a student of Gratian comes from at least two internal references
in his *Summa*:[^17] Simon refers to Gratian as *magister* and to
himself as *discipulus* in his comments on C.27 q.2,[^tmp1] and
again refers to Gratian as *magister* in his comments on D.4 c.31
of *de Consecratione*: "*Quod quamuis Magister noster docuerit, nos
tamen in hoc nolumus eum imitari.* Although our master taught that,
we nevertheless do not wish to imitate him in
this."[@simon_of_bisignano_summa_2014, 542] (trans. PLE)

There is however a hiatus of almost four decades between the latest
plausible date for the end of Gratian's teaching career and the
documentary evidence we have for Simon's professional career as a
canonist. Although it is not quite chronologically impossible for
Simon to have been Gratian's student, it seems far more likely that
he described himself as *discipulus* in something like the same
sense that we might describe contemporary scholars like Chodorow,
Pennington, and Winroth as "students of Gratian". Yet again, we
appear to dealing with statements that on the surface appear to be
about the biography of Gratian---a claim by Simon that he had been
Gratian's student---but that should more plausibly be read as an
acknowledgement of Gratian's authority as the founder of an
intellectual tradition. It is an authority that Simon makes clear
is not without its limits.

Before moving on from the quite limited claims made by presumably
informed contemporaries such as Stephen of Tournai, Paucapalea,
Robert of Torigni, and Simon of Bisignano on behalf of Gratian's
authority and authorship of the *Decretum*, two final observations
on the question of authority should be added.

The problem of authorship and authority was particularly acute in
the first half of the twelfth century, because early scholastic
readers were much more alert to the gaps in the armor of traditional
authorities than their less-sophisticated predecessors had been.
Peter Abelard was unique in the radicalism of his solution to the
problem: in *Sic et non*, he subverted and indeed dissolved the
entire notion of authority by showing that texts written by equally
authoritative authors were in actual, not just apparent, disagreement.
Gratian in contrast to Abelard undertook an intellectually conservative
hermeneutical project of harmonizing the apparently discordant
canons to the level of sophistication demanded by a twelfth-century
scholastic audience, and accordingly adopted a strategy of locating
authority in the texts that he quoted.

It also seems that the widespread reception of the *Decretum* as
itself authoritative benefited from an entirely accidental feature
of the text. The page layout of early manuscripts of the *Decretum*---the
placement of Gratian's *dicta* inline with the authorities rather
on the margins---had the unintentional effect of promoting Gratian
himself to the status of an authority (or at least to a status of
near-equality with his authorities). Even though the specific page
layout was probably adopted in the 1130s or 1140s for no particular
reason other than that the conventions for the various genres of
the literature of canon law had not yet been firmly established,
readers in the 1150s and 1160s seem to have understood it, at least
implicitly, as a claim to authority, a claim that they were more
than willing to accept.[^18] This was almost certainly an over-reading
of the authority claim actually being made in the *Decretum*.[^19]

## Author

Very little is known about the historical Gratian, and almost
everything that previous generations thought was known about Gratian
has proved, on closer examination, to be myth.[@noonan_gratian_1979]
On the evidence found in the *Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been
less interested in contemporary ecclesiastical or secular politics
in general, and in the Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) in
particular, than some modern scholars think he ought to have been.
Gratian similarly seems, based on the relatively limited use he
makes in the *Decretum* of material from the *Codex* and *Digest*
of Justinian, to have been either less interested in, or less
well-informed about, the revival of the study of Roman law in the
early twelfth century than we think he ought to have been. On the
other hand, he seems to have been more well-informed about, and
more interested in, the emergence of scholastic theology in northern
France than we can easily explain.[^21]

### Noonan

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself
is John T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian
slept here: The changing identity of the father of the systematic
study of canon law". Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating
that there is no sound historical basis for most of the affirmative
statements that many mid-twentieth century handbooks and reference
works presented as commonplace.[@noonan_gratian_1979] It is unnecessary
to exhaustively catalog all of the many Gratian myths that Noonan
debunked. A single example, his examination of the history of the
claim that Gratian was a Camaldolese monk at the monastery of Saints
Felix and Nabor in Bologna---one of the most prominent elements of
the mythology surrounding Gratian---is sufficient to illustrate the
nature of Noonan's method and conclusions.

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that
Gratian "was staying" (*stabat*) at the monastery of Saints Felix
and Nabor while working as a rubricator.[^23] Odofredus did not
indicate the basis for his statement that Gratian had been resident
at Saints Felix and Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a
monk. In 1758, Camaldolese scholars Mittarelli and Costadono
discovered papal privileges conferred in 1113 and 1153 identifying
Saints Felix and Nabor as Camaldolese, and inferred from them that
the monastery---and by extension Gratian himself---had been Camaldolese
during the intervening years. The claim that Gratian had a connection
to the Camaldolese order attracted criticism in the eighteenth
century, and fell out of favor in the nineteenth century, before
being put back into circulation in the mid-twentieth century by Van
Hove.[^24]

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and
the courtroom to the historical record. Noonan relied heavily on
the legal hearsay standard as understood and applied by twentieth-century
American courts of law as the basis for his debunking of much Gratian
mythology. By Noonan's standards, the statement of Odofredus---hearsay,
not attributed to a source, a century after the fact---is nothing
more than legend.

Winroth has questioned whether this is an appropriate standard for
evaluating historical evidence.[^25] Noonan's insistence on adhering
to the courtroom rules of evidence can seem like overkill. If, after
all, the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna was in the
hands of Camaldolese communities in 1113 and 1153, it does not seem
unreasonable to infer that it was in the hands of one in the 1120s
and 1130s when Gratian was putatively associated with the foundation,
whatever we think the nature of that association to have been. But
Noonan's caution seems justified when we consider, for example,
Southern's having seized upon the one thinly-sourced datum of the
Camaldolese connection as the foundation for his entire reconstruction
of Gratian's intentions and motivations in undertaking the *Decretum*
project, including a peremptory dismissal of any possibility that
Gratian had a teaching career.[^26]

<!--

Noonan briefly discusses an entry in the chronicle of Robert of
Torigni identifying Gratian as bishop of Chiusi. Noonan considers
that claim unverifiable.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 153-154] The
since-discovered Siena necrology makes Robert's identification more
plausible, though by no means certain.

  -->

Noonan's wide-ranging skepticism extended considerably further than
this or that alleged fact about Gratian's biography; he expressed
significant doubt about the assumption that a text like the *Decretum*
had a single author:

> There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to be
determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three distinctive
parts, with several distinctive sections within the parts, and these
parts have undergone editing as to chapter headings, chapter
insertions, and chapter order. Whatever the later formal ascription,
is Gratian responsible for all the parts? The other difficulty is
the range of roles the one 'responsible' person might have
had---compiler, commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one
or all? The difficulties relate to each other, because evidence
that Gratian was, say, the commentator of Part II does not establish
what role he had in Part I.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 162-163]

Noonan did leave open one affirmative possibility, that a Gratian
who was recorded as having participated in an 1143 case in Venice
as one of three legal consultants ("magister Walfredus", "Gratianus",
and "Moysis", in that order)[^28] advising a three-judge panel
presided over by a papal legate, Cardinal Goizo, might be the same
Gratian responsible for the *Decretum*.

> But we can say that it is possible, even plausible, that the
unbiased notary who recorded the scene at S. Marco is the only
person to have left an eyewitness account of Gratian.
[@noonan_gratian_1979, 171]

Noonan concludes that

> we have reason to believe that Gratian composed and commented
upon a substantial portion of the Concordia. In such composition
and commentary he revealed himself to be a teacher with theological
knowledge and interests and a lawyer's point of view. He worked in
Bologna in the 1130s and 1140s. Beyond these conclusions, we have
unverified hearsay, palpable legend, and the silent figure in the
shadows of S. Marco.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 172]

This, then, is our starting point. Noonan wrote, however, before
Winroth's discovery of the first recension. Scholarship on the
identity of Gratian in this century has necessarily had to take
into account both Noonan's pruning of his biography and the existence
of the first and second recensions.

### Grebner

One of the earliest attempts to do so was Gundula Grebner's "Lay
patronate in Bologna in the first half of the 12th century: Regular
canons, notaries, and the *Decretum*."[@grebner_patronate_2007]
Grebner's article is usually cited in connection with the 1143 court
case: "Recently, Gundula Grebner uncovered more evidence that would
confirm Gratian's presence in a Venetian courtroom and change
Noonan's plausible to certain."[@pennington_biography_2018, 387]

<!--

Grebner's prosopographic analysis appears to put Gratian on the
"right" side of the Anacletian schism (i.e., on the same side as
Haimeric with the Innocentians).

  -->

### Winroth

Winroth's arguments in chapters 1-5 of *The Making of Gratian's
Decretum* are agnostic as to whether Gratian 1 is the same person
as Gratian 2.

> "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore
chosen to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the
author of the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not
intended to suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have
been the same person."[@winroth_making_2000, 122]

The question of authorial identity is not relevant to the primary
argument that Winroth advances in those chapters, which is that the
Admont, Barcelona, and Florence manuscripts represent a coherent
first recension of the *Decretum* rather than an abbreviation. In
chapter 6 and in his conclusion, however, Winroth observes that the
second recension reflects a considerably more sophisticated legal
culture than that reflected in the first recension, notably in the
reception of concepts and terminology from the study of Roman law,
and argues that it is unlikely that one author underwent such an
intellectual evolution in a single generation.[^34]

Winroth is strongly committed to a late date (1139) for the first
recension on the grounds that he thinks D.63 d.p.c.34 *must* refer
to canon 28 from the Second Lateran Council of 1139. That first-recension
*dictum* makes a reference to a canon, D.63 c.35, that was later
incorporated into the text of the *Decretum* as D.63 c.35 in the
second recension.[^35]

Winroth rejects claims that the Sg manuscript of the *Decretum* is
descended from a version earlier than the first recension, and
argues that it is instead an abbreviation of the first recension
with some interpolations from the second. Winroth therefore does
not see the existence of Sg as a reason to assume either a long
teaching career for Gratian or a long period of incremental development
for the text of the *Decretum*.

Finally, Winroth accepts an entry in a Siena necrology (Siena,
Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati F.I.2, f.5r) brought to scholarly
attention by Francesco Reali as evidence that Gratian the author
of the first recension died as bishop of Chiusi on the feast day
of St Lawrence (August 10) in either 1144 or 1145.[^36] The datum
provided by the necrology, recording the death of a "Gratian of
Chiusi, bishop", considered along with an axiomatic assumption of
an 1139 date for the first recension, strengthens the case from
Winroth's perspective that Gratian, having been elevated to a
bishopric not long after having finished work on the first recension,
was unlikely to have been the author of the second recension.

<!--

*This* argument that Gratian could not have been the author of the
second recension is persuasive if and only if you believe *both*
that the first recension was competed not earlier than 1139 *and*
that Gratian was a bishop by 1143 and dead by 1145. It is however
neither the only nor the strongest argument against Gratian's
authorship of the second recension.

  -->

#### Sg

Much of the debate over whether the *Decretum* was the result of a
continuous or discontinuous process of composition focused on the
Sankt Gallen 673 (Sg) manuscript. Pennington and some of his students
have argued that it represented, at some unknown number of removes,
an earlier version of the *Decretum* than Winroth's first recension.
Winroth and Wei have argued that Sg was a relatively uninteresting
abbreviation of a first recension manuscript with some second
recension interpolations.[^37]

The version of the *Decretum* preserved in the Sankt Gallen
Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript contains somewhat fewer than
1,050 canons,[^38] and is therefore considerably shorter than either
the first recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945) versions
of the text.[^39] Formally, Sg is not divided into parts; all of
its content is presented in the form of cases. The first case,
however, is unique to Sg, and is referred to as *Causa Prima* to
distinguish it from the *Causa* I found in all other pre-vulgate
and vulgate versions of the *Decretum*. (*Causa* I appears as *Causa*
II in Sg.) It contains a subset of canons and *dicta* found in Part
I, presented in almost exactly the same order in which they appear
in other versions of the *Decretum*. (There is one relatively minor
exception with respect to the ordering of the texts, the four canons
corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7 are inserted between
the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.)[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653] Notably, *Causa Prima* contains
no texts (canons or *dicta*) from the *tractatus de legibus*
(distinctions 1-20) and none from Gratian's "epilogue" (distinctions
81-101).

### Pennington

Pennington builds on Larson's conjecture that the canon referred
to at D.63 d.p.c.34 in the first recension and later incorporated
as D.63 c.35 in the second recension is not canon 28 from the Second
Lateran Council (1139), but rather a canon from an earlier council
or synod convened by Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was reissued,
a common practice in the early twelfth century, at Lateran II.[^41]
Pennington supports Larson's conjecture by noting that the text of
the canon as it appears in the *Decretum* includes variants (*facta
fuerit* vs *fuerit celebrata*, and *consensus* vs *assensus*) found
in none of the twenty manuscript witnesses to the Lateran II canons
edited by Martin Brett.[@pennington_biography_2018, 365] Pennington
argues that there is enough doubt as to whether D.63 d.p.c.34 refers
to canon 28 from Lateran II---as opposed to a canon from an earlier
council or synod later reissued with minor textual variations as
canon 28 at Lateran II---that it cannot be used as the sole or
primary basis for imposing a *terminus post quem* of 1139 on the
first recension of the *Decretum*.

Pennington, building on Eichbauer's findings, argues that because
the number of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in
both the margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short of
the number that would be expected if they had been copied from a
Vulgate *Decretum* (87 are missing from Aa, and 62 are missing from
Fd), these manuscripts represent an intermediate "next-to-last"
stage in the development of the *Decretum* text intermediate the
pre-Vulgate and Vulgate versions.[^43] Furthermore, the fact that
the Lateran II canons *are* present in this "next-to-last" stage
undermines the argument going back to Fransen and supported by
Lenherr that the Lateran II canons are a last-minute addition, and
poorly if at all integrated into the argument of the
*Decretum*.[@pennington_biography_2018, 367-368] **Pennington also
cites early manuscripts of the *Decretum* with 99 and 100 distinctions
in Part I as evidence for the continuous evolution of the text
between the first and second recensions.**

<!--

Pennington assumes an Iberian origin for Bc, but wasn't it originally
Italian?

  -->

Pennington's strongest argument in favor of his position on Sg is
not an abbreviation is that the unique *Causa Prima* (an ordered
subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension of
the *Decretum*) includes neither texts from the *tractatus de
legibus* (distinctions 1-20) nor from the "epilogue" (distinctions
81-101). Moreover, four cases, 24-26 and 28, are missing from Sg
entirely. Why, Pennington asks, would an abbreviator do this?

<!--

The subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension
of the *Decretum* from which *Causa Prima* in the Sg manuscript is
composed is ordered, with the relatively insignificant exception
that the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7
are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653]

  -->

There are two aspects to Pennington's reservations about identifying
the Gratian named in the Siena necrology with the author of the
*Decretum*. Pennington is open to the possibility that the author
of the *Decretum* eventually became a bishop somewhere, but questions
whether the person named in the necrology was either the bishop of
Chiusi, or the author of the *Decretum*. He notes that the necrology
refers to "Gratian of Chiusi, bishop", not to "Gratian, bishop of
Chiusi." His second reservation concerning the identification of
the Gratian mentioned in the Siena necrology as "the Gratian is
closely related to his reservation about Grebner's identification
of the Gratian mentioned in the record of the 1143 Venice court
case: neither record accords Gratian the kind of prominence that
might be expected for a figure of such importance. Gratian appears
second on the list of the three legal consultants in the Venice
case, and is not referred to with the honorific title "*Magister*."
And the Siena necrology records nothing beyond the bare facts of a
name, a day (but not year) of death, and that the defunct had been
a bishop from or of Chiusi.

<!--

In his assumption that Gratian must have been well-known, even
famous, in his own lifetime, Pennington disagrees with Kuttner, who
sees Gratian as a figure of shrouded in profound personal obscurity:
"He is one of those deeply admirable men of pious modesty, like the
builders of the medieval cathedrals, whose person is hidden and
effaced completely behind their immortal works."[@kuttner_father_1941, 4].

  -->

<!--

Pennington claims to be arguing that there was one Gratian, but is
in fact arguing that Gratian composed the *Decretum* incrementally
over the course of a teaching career spanning several decades, which
is not quite the same thing. Also, Pennington does not address
Winroth's content-based arguments in favor of the two-author
hypothesis (e.g., differences between the first and second recensions
in terms of the levels of sophistication in the use of Justinianic
Roman Law).

  -->

## Authorship

Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around
the figure of the author.[^45] Three examples from classical and
late antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which this requirement
could be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary ambitions with
the support of highly skilled but unfree labor purchased out of his
personal wealth, most famously his slave and later freedman Tiro.
A wealthy lay patron named Ambrose paid for the secretarial staff
that supported the authorial activities of Origen of Alexandria
(†253).[^46] Quasi-monastic members of the episcopal household of
Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided the scribal support that made
his prodigious authorial output possible. The mode of production
pioneered by Augustine and his household in which monastic labor
enabled the creation of original texts by their authors as well as
the subsequent copying and circulation of finished texts proved a
durable one, and predominated in the Latin West until the thirteenth
century.[^47]

Given the material and social technologies for authorship available
in the twelfth century, creation of a text the size of Gratian's
*Decretum* would necessarily have been a collaborative effort.
Pennington has noted that "Gratian may have had an atelier of
assistants,"[@pennington_biography_2018, 362] but that observation
suggests that the nature of the collaboration between Gratian and
those Pennington conceives of as his assistant needs to be examined
more closely. What substantive intellectual contributions, if any,
did Gratian's collaborators make to the project?[^49] There are a
number of indications, discussed in the previous chapter, that the
*Decretum* outgrew the ability of a single author to effectively
manage the development of the text. The question is whether Gratian's
partial loss of control of the project opened up a space for
genuinely collaborative authorship. The starting point for this inquiry
is a theoretically informed understanding of what authorship is.

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Grebner, Winroth, and
Pennington[^50] reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes
that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we will have
identified the author of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of
the first recension), with authorship of the text understood in a
way not unlike the way in which we might understand the authorship
of a modern literary text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept
of authorship, allowing for the possibility that there might have
been multiple authors.) In conducting this kind of "quest of the
historical Gratian," historians have uncritically accepted a
conceptualization of authorship that is somewhat anachronistic when
applied to a medieval text and has been largely discarded by literary
scholarship over the last half-century.

---

Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death of the Author" and Michel
Foucault's 1969 response "What Is an Author?" are foundational
readings in the theory of authorship.[^51]

### Barthes

"The Death of the Author" holds a place in literary studies somewhat
similar to the place that Noonan's "Gratian Slept Here" holds in
canon law studies---it is a clearing of the ground of older ways
of thinking in the field. Although the title of the essay was a
lightning-rod in 1980s theory war polemics, taken as if Barthes
were arguing that texts somehow wrote themselves, Medievalists will
recognize the French title of the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as
a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*. Barthes's essay is short and relatively
free of arcane technical terms. Barthes was a literary critic and
scholar making an argument to other literary critics and scholars
against the practice of close-reading literary texts with the focus
on the biographical and historical context of the author and its
relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the term "Author" to indicate the conceptualization
of authorship he is arguing against and the term "author" where he
intends to use the word in its more general and non-technical sense.
An Author is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a
literary text, and "is in the same relation of antecedence to his
work as a father to his child." [@barthes_death_1977, 145] Barthes
argues that authors cannot be Authors---no person or persons can
have a parent-child relationship to a text since all literary texts
are socially constructed: "The text is a tissue of quotations drawn
from the innumerable centres of culture." [@barthes_death_1977,
146]

**Gratian may be the author of the *dicta* but he is not their
Author. The *dicta* are socially constructed "tissue[s] of quotations
drawn from the innumerable centres of culture."**

The Barthes's central argument is against precisely the kind of
reading that is prevalent in scholarship on Gratian and the *Decretum*:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to
furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a
conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting
itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases:
society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author
has been found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.
[@barthes_death_1977, 147]

Barthes uses the term "scriptor" to indicate an alternative
conceptualization of authorship in which the performative aspect
of the author's act is the central focus. Barthes uses the terms
"criticism" and "critic" to refer respectively to the activity of
close-reading a literary text and one engaging in that activity.
Translating the terms as "reading" and "reader" would not be seriously
misleading. Gratian as author of the *dicta* is therefore, using
Barthes's definitions, both scriptor and critic. The *dicta* were
originally delivered in a classroom setting, and thus have both a
performative and a contemporaneous aspect ("there is no other time
than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written
*here* and *now*" [@barthes_death_1977, 145]) The *dicta* are also
the record of a particular close-reading of a selection of authoritative
texts.

### Foucault

Barthes's criticism of the idea of authorship is apophatic, concerned
mostly with what, in his view, authorship is not. Barthes warns
against the conceptualization of authorship, centered on the
biographical-historical context of the individual author, that most
historians (including those who have written about Gratian's
authorship of the *Decretum*) take for granted. In place of the
conceptualization of authorship rendered suspect by Barthes, Foucault
proposes the idea of the "author function." He starts by asking
"[w]hat is an author’s name? How does it function?"[@foucault_what_1998,
209] and then goes on to observe:

> ... if we proved that Shakespeare did not write those sonnets
which pass for his, that would constitute a significant change and
affect the manner in which the author's name functions. If we proved
that Shakespeare wrote Bacon's *Organon* by showing that the same
author wrote both the works of Bacon and those of Shakespeare, that
would ... entirely modify the functioning of the author's
name.[@foucault_what_1998, 210]

Foucault has a reputation for using esoteric vocabulary in his
writing---his critics would say jargon---in a way that many historians
find objectionable. The technical use of the term "author function"
is a case in point. The idea that he is attempting to convey,
however, is relatively straightforward. Abstract away the biographical
details about the author from the work that the *idea* of the author
does for us when we read a text, and what remains is the author
function. Ironically, given the rather avant-garde reputation that
is still attached to his name at least in the English-speaking
world, Foucault derives the substantive content of the idea of the
author function almost entirely from Jerome (†420).

> In *De Viris illustribus*, Saint Jerome explains that homonymy
is not sufficient to identify legitimately authors of more than one
work ... The name as an individual trademark is not enough when one
works within a textual tradition. [@foucault_what_1998, 214]

This is significant. We face in the *Decretum* a problem concerning
authorship that medieval textual scholars like Abelard and Gratian
himself would have found quite familiar: a textual tradition to
which the name of Gratian became attached quite early on "as an
individual trademark." Furthermore, modern theories of literary
authorship are substantially derived from the work of the figure
that Gratian's twelfth-century contemporaries, most notably Abelard,
considered supremely authoritative on precisely this kind of problem.[^59]

> How, then can one attribute several discourses to one and the same
author? How can one use the author function to determine if one is
dealing with one or several individuals? Saint Jerome proposes four
criteria:[^60]

Only two of Jerome's four criteria (the second and fourth) have
figured significantly in recent scholarship on the authorship of
Gratian's *Decretum*.

> \(1\) if among several books attributed to an author one is
inferior to the others, it must be withdrawn from the list of the
author's works (the author is therefore defined as a constant level
of value);

> \(2\) the same should be done if certain texts contradict the
doctrine expounded in the author’s other works (the author is thus
defined as a field of conceptual or theoretical coherence);

Winroth argues that the second recension of the *Decretum* reflects
a level of reception of Roman Law doctrine so much more advanced
than the first recension that the two recensions cannot be attributed
to a single author.

> \(3\) one must also exclude works that are written in a different
style, containing words and expressions not ordinarily found in the
writer’s production;

> \(4\) finally, passages quoting statements made or mentioning
events that occurred after the author's death must be regarded as
interpolated texts (the author is seen as a historical figure at
the crossroads of a certain number of events). [@foucault_what_1998,
214]

Foucault's essay is a response to Barthes's.

Foucault's essay is more directly relevant than Barthes's to the
problems of authorship raised by Gratian's *Decretum*,

[^1]: The purpose of the first (Authority) section of this chapter
is to show, more than tell, that most of the medieval statements
that modern historians take to be evidence about the biography of
the author or the authorship of the text are really statements about
the *authority* of either Gratian or the *Decretum*.

    You summarized the purpose of the second (Author) section of
    this chapter---which at the time we took to *be* the chapter---thusly:

    "The third order of business then is to recount the history of
    efforts, from the *Summa Parisiensis* on, of legal scholars and
    historians to find the man behind the name Gratian. Here, you
    need to lay out the traditional evidence used for solving this
    puzzle.  You are lucky that Noonan, Pennington etc. have laid
    out the evidence and played with it for you." – Stan Chodorow

    Is the *Summa Parisiensis* just an example, or is there something
    particularly significant about the evidence it provides regarding
    Gratian and the *Decretum* that I need to specifically address?

[^18]: "In the first recension, Gratian I both collected authoritative
texts and commented upon them, as did Peter Lombard in his roughly
contemporary *Sentences*. Both texts were written to meet the need
for a basic text-book in the teaching of their respective disciplines.
Other fields, such as Roman law, medicine, and biblical studies,
already possessed authoritative texts which could serve as the basis
for the teacher's commentary and interpretation. Gratian I and the
Lombard were in effect forced to create their own authoritative
texts (their authority deriving from the fact that they consisted
mainly of quotations) to be able effectively to teach their subjects.
When they did this, they had no reason to separate text from
commentary. They could not have suspected that their texts would
become standard school-texts, nor did they know that it later would
become common to keep text and commentary separate. Could they ever
have guessed how great the growth of their subjects would be after
their deaths? In their works, we can observe teachers creating tools
for their own teaching when there were as yet no standard forms for
academic texts in their subjects. The development of glosses,
*summae*, *questiones*, *distinctiones*, etc., came later, as did
the awareness of teachers like Bernard of Pavia that their compilations
might become standard school-texts (and, hence, that comments were
best relegated to the margins)." @winroth_making_2000, 191.

[^19]: At most, there seems to have been a limited claim of authority
being made by the authors of the first-recension *dicta* (Gratian 1)
on behalf of their *magister*, the author of the case statements
(Gratian 0), whose harmonization of the canons was authoritative
for them.

[^21]: See @kuttner_father_1941. Kuttner argues that Gratian applied
Ivo's program as it had been developed in the intervening forty
years by scholastic theology, most notably by Abelard, and not in
its original form: scholastic theology got the program from Ivo,
Gratian got it from scholastic theology. See also @luscombe_abelard_1969;
and @winroth_where_2013, 111.

[^23]: Noonan identifies Odofredus as the source for associating
Gratian with Saints Felix and Nabor. @noonan_gratian_1979, 148; but
cf. @southern_scholastic_1995, 286n5. Southern draws attention to
an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the *Decretum*,
Bibliothèque publique et universitaire, MS Lat. 60: *Anno domini
MCL a Gratiano S. Feliciani Bononiensis monacho editum*. Pennington
does not identify the manuscript as one known to date from the
twelfth century (see Kenneth Pennington,
[Gratianus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a242),
*Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists*),
and of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript
was produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription
as independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian
and Saints Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible
that it predates Odofredus.

[^24]: See @noonan_gratian_1979, 150-151. @van_hove_prolegomena_1945
had an outsized impact on the trajectory of medieval canon law
studies in twentieth century North America because of its having
been used by the 1964 Yale seminar led by Peter Landau in the absence
of Stephan Kuttner, who was undergoing treatment for cancer at the
time. Seminar participants including Charles Donahue and Robert
Somerville went on to have unusually influential academic careers
in the field (Donahue at Harvard, and Somerville at Columbia where
he was Winroth's dissertation advisor).

[^25]: "Noonan used sound historical methods, but he chose, as a
distinguished professor of law and later a prominent judge, to couch
his method in lawyerly terms, talking about hearsay and wanting to
cross-examine witnesses. To make any headway with as complex and
difficult a problem as Gratian's biography, it will be important
to cling a bit more closely than Noonan did to classical historical
methodology and terminology, as they have been codified from the
late nineteenth century on." @winroth_where_2013, 106.

[^26]: R.W. Southern takes an extreme position with respect to
Gratian's teaching career, citing as late as 1995 Gratian's supposed
association with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that
he had never been a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death
affirmed that Gratian was a Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian
Order, a small Italian branch of the Benedictines, which combined
austerity of life with considerable freedom to contribute to the
work of the Church in a wide variety of ways. This is what Gratian
did. He engaged in a very un-monastic branch of study, and produced
a law book which became the most widely distributed and probably
most generally used of all the masterpieces of twelfth-century
learning." "the book, and not the teaching of pupils, was the
offering Gratian's monastic life brought to the Church".
@southern_scholastic_1995, 286-287, 304.

[^28]: Pennington reads a great deal into the order (why wasn't
Gratian referred to first?) and the honorifics (why wasn't Gratian
referred to as "Magister"?). @pennington_biography_2018, 387-388.
There is, however, no reason to assume that the notary who reported
on the proceedings would necessarily have been well-informed about
Gratian, who was, after all, not a local figure in Venice.

[^34]: Winroth has since come to contextualize the differences
between the first and second recension with respect to the use of
Roman law within a broader context: "The argument about two authors
is based on textual (you could almost say literary) analysis:
formulations, practices of organization, source use, etc. Justinian’s
Roman law books is really the only category of source only used in
one of the two recensions. I used to think that there were other
sources, such as 3L, that were only used in the second recension,
but this turned out to be an accident of the specific sections I
used as case studies (C. 24 and C.11 q.3)." (Anders Winroth, email
to Paul Evans, 18 May 2021).

[^35]: Cite Winroth's dissertation, 345, where he appears
open to the possibility that D.63 d.p.c.34 is an interpolation,
without committing to it. Winroth ultimately accepted the argument
of Rudolf Weigand (†1998) that the interpolation hypothesis is a
slippery slope---once you start rejecting problematic passages
because they are inconvenient (chronologically or otherwise), there
is no obvious place to stop.

d.p.c.34 *is* central to Winroth's arguments in favor of a late
date for the first recension (1139), and for a short teaching career
for Gratian, but is not relevant to his argument in favor of the
two-author hypothesis. "The reference to Lateran II only proves
that the *Decretum*, as transmitted by extant manuscripts (and I
have checked several dozens, 'vulgate' as well as 'pre-vulgate'),
cannot have been written before 1139." (Anders Winroth, email to
Paul Evans, 18 May 2021). As noted in Chapter 2 and the footnote
above, the original basis for Winroth's two-author hypothesis was
that the second recension makes much more sophisticated use of Roman
law concepts and terminology than the first recension.

[^59]: "We must also be very careful not to be deceived by a false
attribution of authorship or by a corrupt text ... Jerome, that
most reliable writer and most faithful translator, has given us
forewarning of this." @abelard_prologue_1988, 89. **"Illud quoque
diligenter attendi convenit ne ... falsa tituli inscriptione vel
scripturae ipsius corruptione fallamur ... Unde fidelissimus scriptor
et veracissimus interpres Hieronymus ... nos praemonuit." Boyer and
McKeon, 91.**

[^60]: @foucault_what_1998, 214. Foucault claims to have derived
the four criteria for determining whether a given "discursive set"
has one or several authors from Jerome's *De Viris illustribus*.
He provides, however, no citations. Walzer and Inabinit indicate
that "similar principles" can be found in @hulley_principles_1944,
105-109. @walzer_who_2011, 188. The section of Hulley's article
on "various points pertinent to questions of authorship" is in fact
almost certainly the ultimate source for Foucault's four criteria,
and provides citations to many works by Jerome (not just *De Viris
illustribus*) relevant to the question of determining the authorship
of a text or texts.
