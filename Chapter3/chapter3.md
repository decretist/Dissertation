subtitle: Authority, Author, Authorship
---
The purpose of this chapter is to examine the closely connected
questions of the authority of the *Decretum*, the biography of its
historical author author, and the authorship of the *Decretum*.
Recent scholarship on the *Decretum* has tended to confuse the
question of the biography of its historical author with that of the
authorship of the text. I will attempt to demonstrate that the
failure to uphold a rigorous distinction between the two has been
a factor in the scholarly controversy over authorship.[^1]

Scholars, such as Noonan, Winroth, and Pennington, who have
investigated the authorship of the *Decretum* in recent decades
have primarily been interested in the question of who wrote the
exact words the text contains. That emphasis on the attribution of
exact words does not accord well with either medieval definitions
of authorship or those found in current theories of authorship.
(Contemporary theories of literary authorship are, ironically,
closer to medieval theories of authorship than either are to the
definition of authorship tacitly assumed by most historians and in
some interesting cases draw on late antique and medieval sources.)

Medieval sources on whom we rely for most of our evidence about who
wrote the *Decretum*, the authors of glosses or of prefaces to
twelfth-century *summae* on the *Decretum*, were not uninterested
in the question of who wrote the exact words in the text. That
question, however, overlapped for them, in a way that it does not
for us, with the question of who was the ultimate source of the
text's authority. Recent scholarship sometimes misinterprets
twelfth-century statements that are really about the authority of
the author or of the work as instead being statements about the
biography of Gratian or about the authorship of the *Decretum*. The
overlapping questions of the authority, author, and authorship of
the *Decretum* therefore have to be considered carefully and, where
necessary, distinctly.

# Authority

In the middle ages, to presume to take on the role of *auctor* was
to make a claim (at least implicitly) to *auctoritas*. Medieval
writers were in general quite reticent about making claims to
authority on their own behalf and employed a variety of techniques
to maintain plausible deniability that they were in fact claiming
authorship and the authority that went with it. Some repudiated the
role of author altogether and circulated the texts they wrote either
anonymously or pseudonymously under the name of a canonical author
of unquestioned authority. Augustine was the overwhelming favorite,
and Gratian extensively quoted in his *de Penitentia* from a text,
*De vera et falsa penitentia*, that circulated under such false
pretenses. Others sought to distance themselves from the role of
author by locating authority in texts they quoted rather than in
the original use they made of those quoted texts in their own
writing.[^2] Gratian made use of both strategies. He circulated the
*Decretum* anonymously and made no overt claim for the authority
of his collection other than that derived from the patristic texts
he extracted out of his material sources. In any event, the modern
notion that the ultimate source for the authority of a text is the
independent judgment passed by a reader on the validity of the
arguments it contains is simply not applicable to the twelfth
century.

We have already encountered two twelfth-century statements on the
authority, author, and authorship of the *Decretum*. The first was
the gloss inserted in lieu of a title at the beginning of the early
Ghent (Gt), Paris (Pf), and Trier (Tr) manuscripts: "*Concordia
discordantium canonum iuxta determinationem Gratiani episcopi quae
in duas partes principaliter est divisa* (The reconciliation of contradictory
canons according to the determination of Bishop Gratian, which is
principally divided into two parts.)"[^3] The glossator provides
Gratian's name, but advances at best an ambivalent claim with respect
to his authorship of the *Decretum*. The glossator includes the
possibly helpful information that Gratian had been a bishop. We do
not know what basis the glossator had for making this statement and
therefore cannot form a judgment as to its reliability. The default
stance of modern scholarship would be to understand this as being
a statement (whether true or false) about the biography of Gratian.
It is, however, the kind of evidence that must be evaluated with
particular care. The teaching authority of the church is vested in
the bishops. To identify Gratian as a bishop is therefore to make
a very specific kind of claim about his authority, and by extension
that of the *Decretum*. The glossator presumably had some reason
to believe that Gratian had actually been a bishop. The purpose of
communicating that information to the reader, however, appears to
have been to advance an authority claim on behalf of the collection
and its compiler.

The second of the two twelfth-century statements on the authority,
author, and authorship of the *Decretum*, which we have also already
encountered, is found in the preface of Stephen of Tournai to his
*Summa* on the *Decretum*:

> *Compositorem huius operis recte dixerim Gratianum, non auctorem.
Capitula namque a sanctis patribus edita in hoc volumine composuit,
i.e. ordinavit. Non eorum auctor vel conditor fuit, nisi forte quis
eum auctorem idcirco dicere velit, quoniam multa ex parte sua
sanctorum sententias distinguendo et exponendo in paragraphis suis
ponit.* (I should properly say that Gratian is the compiler of this
work, not the author, for he brought together in this volume---that
is, he arranged---rulings enacted by the holy Fathers. He was not
their author or framer, unless perchance someone wishes to say that
he is thus the author since he offered on his own in his dicta many
things for clarifying and explicating the opinions of the holy
[Fathers].)[^4]

Stephen also provides Gratian's name, but specifically denies his
authorship of the *Decretum*, demoting him to to the status of a
*compositor*. Unlike the anonymous glossator, Stephen at least
chooses an active-voice verb to characterize Gratian's creative
relationship with the text of the *Decretum*: Gratian, according
to Stephen, "arranged (*ordinavit*)" the canons. Gratian's role is
a distinctly subordinate one, however, confined to "clarifying and
explicating the opinions of the holy Fathers" to whom Stephen looks
as the ultimate source for the authority of the *Decretum*.

Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum* have seen it as
a teaching text, both in the sense that its intended use (or at
least one of its intended uses) was as an introductory textbook and
also in the sense that it reflected the author's experiences as a
classroom teacher. The early manuscript tradition for the *Decretum*
displays enough variation, even among the first-recension
manuscripts---Admont (Aa), Barcelona (Bc), Florence (Fd), and Paris
(P)---to suggest that the text developed continuously over the span
of, and in parallel with, a relatively long teaching career---perhaps
a decade or more. Gratian's students would therefore appear to have
been the potential witnesses with the best visibility into the
authorship of the text of the *Decretum* over the course of the
1130s and possibly as early as the 1120s. Unfortunately, no
near-contemporary makes an unambiguous claim to have been Gratian's
student or to have otherwise had first-hand knowledge of the
circumstances under which the *Decretum* was composed.[^5] Considering
the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the author of the
foundational textbook for the study of canon law in the classical
period, his complete absence from the kinds of academic genealogies
and origin stories that Odofredus (†1265) handed down to his own
Roman law students is striking indeed.[^6] Three twelfth-century
canonists have, however, with varying degrees of plausibility, been
identified as having been students of Gratian: Paucapalea (fl.
1140s), Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179), and Omnibonus or
Omnebene of Verona (d. 1185).

## Paucapalea

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early
period of the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's
immediate footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was
"[a] pupil of Gratian and the author of the first commentary on
the *Decretum*."[^7] But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea
does not refer to Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis
ipsa decreta sunt materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are
the subject matter of the master producing this work."[^8]

The omission is significant. Prefaces to academic books in the
twelfth century formed a recognized genre with well-established
conventions. In an age resistant to any attempt by the human present
to appropriate the authority of the divinely-inspired past, a
commentator like Paucapalea was expected to offer an explicit
statement in his preface affirming the authority of both the work
commented on and its author. If Paucapalea had had something to say
about the authority and authorship of Gratian, his readers would
have expected him to do so in his preface. That he did not suggests
that he did not know enough about Gratian to credibly do so.[^9]

## Omnibonus

Omnibonus or Omnebene of Verona (d.1185) composed an adaptation or
transformation of the *Decretum* in the 1150s.[^10] Even though
Omnibonus lived into the 1180s, the adaptation itself seems to date
from around 1156, perhaps a decade and a half after the end of
whatever teaching career Gratian may have had, so the dates do not
preclude his having been a student of Gratian.[^11] The basis for
the claim that Omnibonus was Gratian's student is an entry for the
year 1130 in the chronicle of the Norman monk Robert of Torigni
(†1186):

> *Gratianus episcopus Clusinus coadunavit decreta valde utilia ex
decretis, canonibus, doctoribus, legibus Romanis, sufficientia ad
omnes ecclesiasticas causas decidendas, que frequentantur in curia
Romana et in aliis curiis ecclesiasticis. Hec postmodum abbreviavit
magister Omnebonum episcopus Veronensis, qui fuerat eius discipulus.*
(Gratian bishop of Chiusi brought together very useful decrees out
of decrees, canons, doctors, Roman laws, sufficient for deciding
all ecclesiastical cases, which are resorted to at the Roman curia
and in other ecclesiastical courts. Master Omnebonum bishop of
Verona, who had been his student, afterwards abbreviated them.)[^12]

Robert of Torigni's brief chronicle entry contains six distinct
factual assertions: i.) that Gratian was bishop of Chiusi, ii.)
that he "brought together the decrees" (*coadunavit decreta*) in a
form useful to, and widely used by, ecclesiastical courts, iii.)
that he did so around 1130, iv.) that "magister Omnebonum" was
bishop of Verona, v.) that he abbreviated the *Decretum*, and vi.)
that he had been Gratian's student.[^13] Three of these factual
assertions are uncontroversial: that Gratian "brought together" the
*Decretum*, that Omnibonus abbreviated it, and that Omnibonus was
bishop of Verona.

Those scholars who interpret the discovery of the first-recension
manuscripts as evidence that Gratian's work on the *Decretum*
extended over a decade or more---Pennington and Larson, but not
Winroth---have come to see Robert's 1130 date as more plausible
than it had previously been thought to be.[@larson_early_2007,
54-55] Other scholars who accept a twelfth-century reference to a
"Gratian of Chiusi, bishop" in a Siena necrology as referring to
the Gratian associated with the *Decretum*---Winroth, but not
Pennington---have come to see Robert's claim that Gratian was the
bishop of Chiusi as more plausible than it had previously been
thought to be. The result is that Robert's overall reputation as a
well-informed source concerning Gratian has improved in this century
without there necessarily being much agreement as to whether the
claim that Gratian was working on the *Decretum* around 1130 or
that he was bishop of Chiusi ought to be considered more credible
in light of the newly available evidence.

The best place to look for first-hand evidence from Omnibonus about
Gratian and whether he had been Gratian's student, as well as the
circumstances under which the *Decretum* was composed, would be in
a preface to his abbreviation. Unfortunately, there is no printed
edition of the abbreviation, and the only form in which a manuscript
of the abbreviation is available is a low-resolution digitization
of an old microfilm of Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France,
Latin 3886. It does not appear to have a preface of any kind, but
launches immediately into the abbreviation starting with "*Humanum
genus duobus regitur*." In the apparent absence then of any first-hand
evidence from Omnibonus himself, we have only Robert's word that
Omnibonus was Gratian's student, and so, like Noonan, "[w]e are
left to speculate as to how sound his story was."[@noonan_gratian_1979,
153-154] In the end, there may be little more informational content
to be extracted from the statement than that Robert understood
Omnibonus to be working within a specific intellectual tradition
of which Gratian was, by that time, the acknowledged founder.

## Simon of Bisignano

Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179) was the author of a *Summa
decretorum* dated c.1177-79, and a number of glosses on the *Decretum*
are attributed to him.[^16] The evidence that Simon of Bisignano
was a student of Gratian comes from at least two internal references
in his *Summa*:[^17] Simon refers to Gratian as *magister* and to
himself as *discipulus* in his comments on C.27 q.2,[^18] and again
refers to Gratian as *magister* in his comments on D.4 c.31 of *de
Consecratione*: "*Quod quamuis Magister noster docuerit, nos tamen
in hoc nolumus eum imitari.* Although our master taught that, we
nevertheless do not wish to imitate him in
this."[@simon_of_bisignano_summa_2014, 542] (trans. PLE)

There is, however, a hiatus of almost four decades between the
latest plausible date for the end of Gratian's teaching career and
the documentary evidence we have for Simon's professional career
as a canonist. Although it is not quite chronologically impossible
for Simon to have been Gratian's student, it seems far more likely
that he described himself as *discipulus* in something like the
same sense that we might describe contemporary scholars like Chodorow,
Pennington, and Winroth as "students of Gratian." Yet again, we
appear to be dealing with statements that on the surface appear to
be about the biography of Gratian---a claim by Simon that he had
been Gratian's student---but that should more plausibly be read as
an acknowledgement of Gratian's authority as the founder of an
intellectual tradition. It is an authority that Simon makes clear
is not without its limits.

Before moving on from the quite limited claims made by presumably
informed contemporaries such as Stephen of Tournai, Paucapalea,
Robert of Torigni, and Simon of Bisignano on behalf of Gratian's
authority and authorship of the *Decretum*, two final observations
on the question of authority should be added.

The problem of authorship and authority was particularly acute in
the first half of the twelfth century, because early scholastic
readers were much more alert to the gaps in the armor of traditional
authorities than their less-sophisticated predecessors had been.
Peter Abelard was unique in the radicalism of his solution to the
problem: in *Sic et non*, he subverted and indeed dissolved the
entire notion of authority by showing that texts written by equally
authoritative authors were in actual, not just apparent, disagreement.
Gratian in contrast to Abelard undertook an intellectually conservative
hermeneutical project of harmonizing the apparently discordant
canons to the level of sophistication demanded by a twelfth-century
scholastic audience, and accordingly adopted a strategy of locating
authority in the texts that he quoted.

It also seems that the widespread reception of the *Decretum* as
itself authoritative benefited from an entirely accidental feature
of the text. The page layout of early manuscripts of the *Decretum*---the
placement of Gratian's *dicta* inline with the authorities rather
than on the margins---had the unintentional effect of promoting
Gratian himself to the status of an authority (or at least to a
status of near-equality with his authorities). Even though the
specific page layout was probably adopted in the 1130s or 1140s for
no particular reason other than that the conventions for the various
genres of the literature of canon law had not yet been firmly
established, readers in the 1150s and 1160s seem to have understood
it, at least implicitly, as a claim to authority, a claim that they
were more than willing to accept.[^20] This was almost certainly
an over-reading of the authority claim actually being made in the
*Decretum*.[^21]

# Author

In contrast with medieval scholars who were relatively unconcerned
about the fact that they knew little to nothing about Gratian, and
for whom in any event the question of the textual authority of the
*Decretum* was primary, modern scholars have maintained a resolute
focus on the biography of the historical Gratian, on the implicit
assumption that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we will
have identified the author of the *Decretum*. Very little, in fact,
is known about the historical Gratian, and almost everything that
previous generations thought was known about Gratian has proved,
on closer examination, to be myth.[@noonan_gratian_1979] On the
evidence found in the *Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been less
interested in contemporary ecclesiastical or secular politics in
general, and in the Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) in particular,
than some modern scholars think he ought to have been. Gratian
similarly seems, based on the relatively limited use he makes in
the *Decretum* of material from the *Codex* and *Digest* of Justinian,
to have been either less interested in, or less well-informed about,
the revival of the study of Roman law in the early twelfth century
than we think he ought to have been. On the other hand, he seems
to have been more well-informed about, and more interested in, the
emergence of scholastic theology in northern France than we can
easily explain.[^23]

## Noonan

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself
is John T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian
slept here: The changing identity of the father of the systematic
study of canon law." Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating
that there is no sound historical basis for most of the affirmative
statements that many mid-twentieth-century handbooks and reference
works presented as commonplace.[@noonan_gratian_1979] It is unnecessary
to exhaustively catalog all of the many Gratian myths that Noonan
debunked. A single example, his examination of the history of the
claim that Gratian was a Camaldolese monk at the monastery of Saints
Felix and Nabor in Bologna---one of the most prominent elements of
the mythology surrounding Gratian---is sufficient to illustrate the
nature of Noonan's method and conclusions.

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that
Gratian "was staying" (*stabat*) at the monastery of Saints Felix
and Nabor while working as a rubricator.[^25] Odofredus did not
indicate the basis for his statement that Gratian had been resident
at Saints Felix and Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a
monk. In 1758, Camaldolese scholars Mittarelli and Costadono
discovered papal privileges conferred in 1113 and 1153 identifying
Saints Felix and Nabor as Camaldolese, and inferred from them that
the monastery---and by extension Gratian himself---had been Camaldolese
during the intervening years. The claim that Gratian had a connection
to the Camaldolese order attracted criticism in the eighteenth
century and fell out of favor in the nineteenth century, before
being put back into circulation in the mid-twentieth century by Van
Hove.[^26]

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and a judge on
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals who applied the standards of
evidence of the law school and the courtroom to the historical
record. Noonan relied heavily on the legal hearsay standard as
understood and applied by twentieth-century American courts of law
as the basis for his debunking of much Gratian mythology. By Noonan's
standards, the statement of Odofredus---hearsay, not attributed to
a source, a century after the fact---is nothing more than legend.

Winroth has questioned whether this is an appropriate standard for
evaluating historical evidence.[^27] Noonan's insistence on adhering
to the courtroom rules of evidence can seem like overkill. If, after
all, the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna was in the
hands of Camaldolese communities in 1113 and 1153, it does not seem
unreasonable to infer that it was Camaldolese in the 1120s and 1130s
when Gratian was putatively associated with the foundation, whatever
we may think the nature of that association to have been. But
Noonan's caution seems justified when we consider, for example,
that R.W. Southern seized upon the one thinly-sourced datum of the
Camaldolese connection as the foundation for his entire reconstruction
of Gratian's intentions and motivations in undertaking the *Decretum*
project, including a peremptory dismissal of any possibility that
Gratian had a teaching career.[^28]

The entry in the chronicle of Robert of Torigni identifying Gratian
as bishop of Chiusi and teacher of Omnibonus is another of the many
pieces of testimony from the Gratian legendary that Noonan
cross-examines, although he ultimately dismisses Robert's identification
as unverifiable.[^29]

Noonan's wide-ranging skepticism extended considerably further than
this or that alleged fact about Gratian's biography; he expressed
significant doubt about the assumption that a text like the *Decretum*
had a single author:

> There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to be
determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three distinctive
parts, with several distinctive sections within the parts, and these
parts have undergone editing as to chapter headings, chapter
insertions, and chapter order. Whatever the later formal ascription,
is Gratian responsible for all the parts? The other difficulty is
the range of roles the one 'responsible' person might have
had---compiler, commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one
or all? The difficulties relate to each other, because evidence
that Gratian was, say, the commentator of Part II does not establish
what role he had in Part I.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 162-163]

Noonan did leave open one affirmative possibility, that a Gratian
who was recorded as having participated in an 1143 case in Venice
as one of three legal consultants ("magister Walfredus," "Gratianus,"
and "Moysis," in that order)[^31] advising a three-judge panel
presided over by a papal legate, Cardinal Goizo, might be the same
Gratian as the one responsible for the *Decretum*.[^32]

> But we can say that it is possible, even plausible, that the
unbiased notary who recorded the scene at S. Marco is the only
person to have left an eyewitness account of Gratian.
[@noonan_gratian_1979, 171]

Noonan concludes that

> we have reason to believe that Gratian composed and commented
upon a substantial portion of the Concordia. In such composition
and commentary he revealed himself to be a teacher with theological
knowledge and interests and a lawyer's point of view. He worked in
Bologna in the 1130s and 1140s. Beyond these conclusions, we have
unverified hearsay, palpable legend, and the silent figure in the
shadows of S. Marco.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 172]

This conclusion is our starting point. Noonan wrote, however, before
Winroth's discovery of the first recension. Scholarship on the
identity of Gratian in this century has necessarily had to take
into account both Noonan's pruning of his biography and the existence
of the first and second recensions.

## Winroth

Winroth discusses the biography of Gratian directly in the sixth
chapter of *The Making of Gratian's Decretum* ("The men behind the
'Decretum'"),[@winroth_making_2000, 175-192] and in a 2013 ZRG KA
article, "Where Gratian Slept: The Life and Death of the Father of
Canon Law."[@winroth_where_2013] The article expands on material
Winroth presented at the Fourteenth International Congress of
Medieval Canon Law, Toronto, 2012. Furthermore, Winroth vigorously
participated in the debate over the Sankt Gallen Stiftsbibliothek
673 (Sg) manuscript of Gratian's *Decretum*, most notably in a 2014
BMCL article, "Recent Work on the making of Gratian's
Decretum,"[@winroth_recent_2004] and his views on Sg influence the
arguments he makes about the trajectory of Gratian's teaching career.

In *The Making of Gratian's Decretum*, Winroth adopts the convention
of referring to the author of the first recension as Gratian 1 and
to the author of the second recension as Gratian 2. The arguments
he makes in the first five chapters of his book are agnostic as to
whether Gratian 1 is the same person as Gratian 2: "These labels
are not intended to suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not
have been the same person."[@winroth_making_2000, 122] The question
of authorial identity is not relevant to the primary argument that
Winroth advances in those chapters, which is that the Admont (Aa),
Barcelona (Bc), and Florence (F) manuscripts represent a coherent
first recension of the *Decretum* rather than an abbreviation. In
his sixth chapter and conclusion, however, Winroth observes that
the second recension reflects a considerably more sophisticated
legal culture than that reflected in the first recension, notably
in the reception of concepts and terminology from the study of Roman
law, and argues that it is unlikely that an author would have
acquired a deep knowledge of Roman law and then incorporated it
into a second recension of his work in the course of a normal
career.[^39]

Winroth is strongly committed to a late date (1139) for the first
recension on the grounds that he thinks D.63 d.p.c.34 *must* refer
to canon 28 from the Second Lateran Council of 1139. That first-recension
*dictum* makes a reference to a canon, D.63 c.35, that was later
incorporated into the second recension of the *Decretum* as D.63
c.35[^40] Winroth explicitly rejects Atria Larson's suggestion that
the canon referred to at D.63 d.p.c.34 is *not* canon 28 from Lateran
II but rather a canon from an earlier council or synod convened by
Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was reissued at the 1139 council,
a common practice in the early twelfth century.[^41]

Furthermore, Winroth accepts an entry in a Siena necrology (Siena,
Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati F.I.2, f.5r) brought to scholarly
attention by Francesco Reali as evidence that Gratian, the author
of the first recension, died as bishop of Chiusi on the feast day
of St. Lawrence (August 10) in either 1144 or 1145.[@winroth_where_2013]
The datum provided by the necrology, recording the death of a
"Gratian of Chiusi, bishop," considered along with Winroth's axiomatic
assumption of an 1139 *terminus post quem* for the first recension,
strengthens the case from his perspective that Gratian, having been
elevated to a bishopric not long after having finished work on the
first recension, was unlikely to have been the author of the second
recension.

Winroth rejects claims that the Sg manuscript of the *Decretum* is
descended from a version earlier than the first recension and argues
instead that it is an abbreviation of the first recension with some
interpolations from the second.[^43] While not a direct intervention
in a debate over the biography of Gratian, Winroth's argument against
Sg being a version of the text of the *Decretum* earlier than the
first recension is an indirect argument against a long teaching
career for Gratian 1, as Winroth conceives him, and against a long
period of incremental development for the text of the *Decretum*.

## Pennington

Pennington discusses the biography of Gratian directly in his article
"The Biography of Gratian, the Father of Canon Law," which has
appeared in multiple, successively revised, versions.[^44] Pennington,
too, has been a vigorous participant in the debate over the
significance of the Sg manuscript of the *Decretum*, most notably
in his 2004 chapter "Gratian, Causa 19, and the Birth of Canonical
Jurisprudence."[@pennington_gratian_2004] In addition, Pennington
directed a 2010 dissertation by Melodie Eichbauer, "From Gratian's
*Concordia discordantium canonum* to Gratian's *Decretum*: The
Evolution from Teaching Text to Comprehensive Code of Canon Law,
that contributed to the debate over Sg.

Pennington builds on Larson's conjecture that the canon referred
to at D.63 d.p.c.34 in the first recension and later incorporated
as D.63 c.35 in the second recension is not canon 28 from the Second
Lateran Council (1139) but rather a canon from an earlier council
or synod convened by Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was reissued
at Lateran II, a common practice in the early twelfth century.[^46]
Pennington supports Larson's conjecture by noting that the text of
the canon as it appears in the *Decretum* includes variants (*facta
fuerit* vs *fuerit celebrata*, and *consensus* vs *assensus*) found
in none of the twenty manuscript witnesses to the Lateran II canons
edited by Martin Brett.[^47] Pennington argues that there is enough
doubt as to whether D.63 d.p.c.34 refers to canon 28 from Lateran
II that it cannot be used as the sole or primary basis for imposing
a *terminus post quem* of 1139 on the first recension of the
*Decretum*.

Pennington, building on Eichbauer's findings, argues that because
the number of additional canons found in the margins of the Barcelona
(Bc) manuscript, and in both the margins and appendices of the
Admont (Aa) and Florence (Fd) manuscripts, fall well short of the
number that would be expected if they had been copied from a vulgate
manuscript of the *Decretum* (87 are missing from Aa, and 62 are
missing from Fd), these manuscripts represent an intermediate
"next-to-last" stage in the development of the *Decretum* text
between the pre-vulgate and vulgate versions.[^48] Furthermore, the
fact that the Lateran II canons *are* present in this "next-to-last"
stage undermines the argument going back to Fransen and supported
by Lenherr that the Lateran II canons are a last-minute addition,
and poorly if at all integrated into the argument of the
*Decretum*.[@pennington_biography_2018, 367-368] Pennington also
cites early manuscripts of the *Decretum* with 99 distinctions in
Part I as evidence for the continuous evolution of the text between
the first and second recensions.[@pennington_biography_2018, 366]

Pennington's strongest argument in favor of his position that Sg
is not an abbreviation is that the unique *Causa Prima* (an ordered
subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension of
the *Decretum*) includes neither texts from the *tractatus de
legibus* (distinctions 1-20) nor from the "epilogue" (distinctions
81-101). Moreover, four cases, 24-26 and 28, are missing from Sg
entirely. There would have been no compelling reason for an abbreviator
starting from a pre-vulgate version of the *Decretum* to make such
changes.[@pennington_biography_2018, 379-380]

There are two aspects to Pennington's reservations about identifying
the Gratian named in the Siena necrology with the author of the
*Decretum*. Pennington is open to the possibility that the author
of the *Decretum* eventually became a bishop somewhere, but questions
whether the person named in the necrology was either the bishop of
Chiusi, or the author of the *Decretum*. He notes that the necrology
refers to "Gratian of Chiusi, bishop," not to "Gratian, bishop of
Chiusi."[@pennington_biography_2018, 386-387] Pennington's second
reservation concerning the identification of the Gratian mentioned
in the Siena necrology as *the* Gratian is closely related to his
reservation about Grebner's identification of the Gratian mentioned
in the record of the 1143 Venice court case: neither record accords
Gratian the kind of prominence that might be expected for a figure
of such importance. Gratian appears second on the list of the three
legal consultants in the Venice case and is not referred to with
the honorific title "*Magister*." And the Siena necrology records
nothing beyond the bare facts of a name, a day (but not year) of
death, and that the defunct had been a bishop from or of Chiusi.[^53]
In his assumption, however, that Gratian must have been well-known,
even famous, in his own lifetime, Pennington disagrees with Kuttner,
who sees Gratian as a figure of shrouded in profound personal
obscurity: "He is one of those deeply admirable men of pious modesty,
like the builders of the medieval cathedrals, whose person is hidden
and effaced completely behind their immortal works."[@kuttner_father_1941,
4].

# Authorship

Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around
the figure of the author.[^55] Three examples from the classical
period and late antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which
this requirement could be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary
ambitions with the support of highly skilled but unfree labor
purchased out of his personal wealth, most famously his slave and
later freedman Tiro. A wealthy lay patron named Ambrose paid for
the secretarial staff that supported the authorial activities of
Origen of Alexandria (†253).[^56] Quasi-monastic members of the
episcopal household of Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided the scribal
support that made his prodigious authorial output possible. The
mode of production pioneered by Augustine and his household in which
monastic labor enabled the creation of original texts by their
authors as well as the subsequent copying and circulation of finished
texts proved a durable one and predominated in the Latin West until
the thirteenth century.[^57]

Given the material and social technologies for authorship available
in the twelfth century, creation of a text the size of Gratian's
*Decretum* would necessarily have been a collaborative effort.
Pennington has noted that "Gratian may have had an atelier of
assistants,"[@pennington_biography_2018, 362] but that observation
suggests that the nature of the collaboration between Gratian and
those Pennington conceives of as his assistants needs to be examined
closely. What substantive intellectual contributions, if any, did
Gratian's collaborators make to the project?[^59] There are a number
of indications, discussed in the previous chapter, that the *Decretum*
outgrew the ability of a single author to effectively manage the
development of the text. The question is whether Gratian's partial
loss of control of the project opened up a space for genuinely
collaborative authorship. The starting point for this inquiry is a
theoretically informed understanding of what authorship is.

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Pennington and Winroth[^60]
reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes that if we can
identify the historical Gratian, we will have identified the author
of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of the first recension),
with authorship of the text understood in a way not unlike the way
in which we might understand the authorship of a modern literary
text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept of authorship,
allowing for the possibility that there might have been multiple
authors.) In conducting this kind of "quest of the historical
Gratian," historians have uncritically accepted a conceptualization
of authorship that is somewhat anachronistic when applied to a
medieval text and has been largely discarded by literary scholarship
over the last half-century. Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death
of the Author" and Michel Foucault's 1969 response "What Is an
Author?" are foundational readings in the theory of authorship and
provide an appropriate starting point for a theoretically-informed
reconsideration of the authorship of Gratian's *Decretum*.[^61]

## Barthes

"The Death of the Author" holds a place in literary studies somewhat
similar to the place that Noonan's "Gratian Slept Here" holds in
canon law studies---it is a clearing of the ground of older ways
of thinking in the field. Although the title of the essay was a
lightning-rod in 1980s theory war polemics, taken as if Barthes
were arguing that texts somehow wrote themselves, medievalists will
recognize the French title of the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as
a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*. Barthes's essay is short and relatively
free of arcane technical terms. Barthes was a literary critic and
scholar making an argument to other literary critics and scholars
against the practice of close-reading literary texts with the focus
on the biographical and historical context of the author and its
relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the term "Author" to indicate the conceptualization
of authorship he is arguing against and the term "author" where he
intends to use the word in its more general and non-technical sense.
An Author is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a
literary text and "is in the same relation of antecedence to his
work as a father to his child." [@barthes_death_1977, 145] Barthes
argues that authors cannot be Authors---no person or persons can
have a parent-child relationship to a text since all literary texts,
which he describes as "a tissue of quotations drawn from the
innumerable centres of culture,"[@barthes_death_1977, 146] are
socially constructed. This description is certainly more applicable
to the *dicta* than to the modern texts that Barthes had in mind.
Gratian may be the author of the *dicta* but he is not their Author.

Barthes's central argument is against precisely the kind of reading
that is prevalent in scholarship on Gratian and the *Decretum*:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to
furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a
conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting
itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases:
society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author
has been found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.
[@barthes_death_1977, 147]

Barthes uses the term "scriptor" to indicate an alternative
conceptualization of authorship in which the performative aspect
of the author's act is the central focus. Barthes uses the terms
"criticism" and "critic" to refer respectively to the activity of
subjecting a literary text to close-reading and to one engaging in
that activity. Translating the terms as "reading" and "reader"
would not be seriously misleading. Gratian as author of the *dicta*
is therefore, using Barthes's definitions, both scriptor and critic.
The *dicta* were originally delivered in a classroom setting and
thus have both a performative and a contemporaneous aspect ("there
is no other time than that of the enunciation and every text is
eternally written *here* and *now*"[@barthes_death_1977, 145]). The
*dicta* are also the record of a particular close-reading of a
selection of authoritative texts. Barthes's critique of the concept
of the Author, then, suggests some interesting ways in which the
conceptualization of authorship usually invoked in scholarship on
the *Decretum* fails to capture, or at least insufficiently emphasizes,
certain important aspects of Gratian's creative activity.

## Foucault

Barthes's criticism of the idea of authorship is apophatic, concerned
mostly with what, in his view, authorship is not. Barthes warns
against the conceptualization of authorship, centered on the
biographical-historical context of the individual author, that most
historians (including those who have written about Gratian's
authorship of the *Decretum*) take for granted. In place of the
conceptualization of authorship rendered suspect by Barthes, Foucault
proposes the idea of the "author function." He starts by asking
"[w]hat is an author's name? How does it function?"[@foucault_what_1998,
209] and then goes on to observe:

> ... if we proved that Shakespeare did not write those sonnets
which pass for his, that would constitute a significant change and
affect the manner in which the author's name functions. If we proved
that Shakespeare wrote Bacon's *Organon* by showing that the same
author wrote both the works of Bacon and those of Shakespeare, that
would ... entirely modify the functioning of the author's
name.[@foucault_what_1998, 210]

Foucault has a reputation for using esoteric vocabulary in his
writing---his critics would say jargon---in a way that many historians
find objectionable. The technical use of the term "author function"
is a case in point. However, the idea that he is attempting to
convey is relatively straightforward. Remove the biographical details
about the author from the function that the *idea* of the author
performs for us when we read a text, and what remains is a
non-biographical author that Foucault terms the "author function."
Ironically, given the rather avant-garde reputation that is still
attached to his name, at least in the English-speaking world,
Foucault derives the substantive content of the idea of the author
function almost entirely from Jerome (†420).

<!--

> In *De Viris illustribus*, Saint Jerome explains that homonymy
is not sufficient to identify legitimately authors of more than one
work ... The name as an individual trademark is not enough when one
works within a textual tradition. [@foucault_what_1998, 214]

This point is significant. We face in the *Decretum* a problem
concerning authorship that medieval textual scholars like Abelard
and Gratian himself would have found quite familiar: a textual
tradition to which the name of Gratian became attached quite early
on "as an individual trademark." Furthermore, Foucault's theory of
literary authorship is substantially derived from the work of Jerome,
the figure that Gratian's twelfth-century contemporaries, most
notably Abelard, considered supremely authoritative on precisely
this kind of problem.[^69]

> How, then can one attribute several discourses to one and the
same author? How can one use the author function to determine if
one is dealing with one or several individuals? Saint Jerome proposes
four criteria:[^70]

The four criteria that Foucault synthesizes from Jerome consider
the author separately as "a constant level of value," "a field of
conceptual or theoretical coherence," "a stylistic unity," and an
"historical figure at the crossroads of a certain number of events."
Each is a criterion for the *exclusion* of a given text from the
canon of a particular author. Three of the four criteria, the first,
second, and fourth, have figured to some extent in recent scholarship
on the authorship of Gratian's *Decretum*; the third has not.

> \(1\) if among several books attributed to an author one is
inferior to the others, it must be withdrawn from the list of the
author's works (the author is therefore defined as a constant level
of value);

> \(2\) the same should be done [i.e., a book must be withdrawn
from the list of the author's works] if certain texts contradict
the doctrine expounded in the author's other works (the author is
thus defined as a field of conceptual or theoretical coherence);

Winroth has argued that the second recension of the *Decretum*
reflects a level of reception of Roman Law doctrine so much more
advanced than the first recension that the two recensions cannot
be attributed to a single author. It is possible to transpose
Winroth's argument into Foucault's framework either by defining the
author as a constant level of value or as a field of conceptual or
theoretical coherence. Winroth himself seems to lean in the direction
of defining the author as a constant level of value: the *dicta*
in the first recension of the *Decretum* are in some sense "inferior"
to those in the second because they reflect a more rudimentary
understanding of Roman Law. While arguments that Gratian made an
explicit ideological choice to de-emphasize Roman law do not presently
play a large role in scholarly debates over the *Decretum*, they
have done so in the past and may do so again in the
future.[@chodorow_ecclesiology_1972, 60-64] To make an argument of
this kind would be defining the author as a field of conceptual or
theoretical coherence. To be clear, the point is not that scholars
such as Pennington and Winroth *are* framing their arguments in the
terms Foucault borrows from Jerome but rather that if the biographical
details of their respective historical Gratians were abstracted
away, their arguments *could* be reframed in those terms.

A work like the *Decretum* can, of course, be evaluated on more
than one scale of value, and lapses in the Latin grammar of the
case statements suggest a standard other than the use of Roman law
on the basis of which texts might be included in or excluded from
the Gratian canon. For example, Gratian in C.3 d.init. uses the
reflexive pronoun *sibi* to refer to enemies of a bishop who is not
the grammatical subject of the clause in which the word occurs,
where *eius* might instead be expected: "*accusatores testes de
domo sua producunt, et alios sibi inimicos extra suam prouinciam*
(the accusers bring forward witnesses from [the bishop's] own
household, and other enemies of his (*sibi*) from outside his
province)." (trans. PLE) Similarly, in C.29 d.init. Gratian uses
the reflexive pronoun *sibi* to refer to a noblewoman who is the
grammatical subject of neither the sentence nor the relative clause
in which the word appears, and where *ei* might instead be expected:
"*Ille, qui sibi prius placuerat, tandem uenit, eamque sibi in
coniugem petit* (Finally he who had previously pleased her (*sibi*)
comes, and asks [for] her in marriage to himself)." (trans. PLE)
It is outside the scope of this dissertation to follow up on anecdotal
evidence of this kind, but the examples at least suggest a possible
direction for future research.[^72]

> \(4\) finally, passages quoting statements made or mentioning
events that occurred after the author's death must be regarded as
interpolated texts (the author is seen as a historical figure at
the crossroads of a certain number of events). [@foucault_what_1998,
214]

The fourth criterion that Foucault derives from Jerome is, for
obvious reasons, the most attractive one from the point of view of
the historian: arguments about the authorship of a text are framed
in terms of the known facts of its putative author's life. This
criterion, however, has extremely limited usefulness in the case
of an author like Gratian about whom almost nothing is reliably
known. Winroth's argument about D.63 d.p.c.34, for example, can be
transposed into Foucault's framework for this criterion only by
shifting the starting point and running the logic in reverse. Winroth
starts with the axiomatic assumption that the first recension of
the *Decretum* contains no interpolations and reasons from that
axiom to the conclusion that Gratian could not have finished the
first recension before 1139. There is nothing inherently suspect
in the framing of arguments about the authorship of a text using
Foucault's fourth criterion, but it is extremely difficult to reach
conclusions that will command general assent in the absence of any
established facts about a putative author's life, especially when
the controverted text in question has an unknown history of its own
(as is the case with the variant texts we know from the Second
Lateran Council as canon 28 and from the *Decretum* as D.63 c.35.)

Jerome's remaining criterion, the third, has **not** figured
significantly in recent scholarship on the authorship of Gratian's
*Decretum*.

> \(3\) one must also exclude works that are written in a different
style, containing words and expressions not ordinarily found in the
writer's production (the author is here conceived as a stylistic
unity);

From this point forward, the dissertation will be taken up with an
extended application of Jerome's third criterion, the criterion of
stylistic unity, to the question of the authorship of the *dicta*
in Gratian's *Decretum*. The introduction offered a preview of the
finding that when the alleged details of Gratian's biography are
abstracted away from the idea of the author, and we instead look
for the author in the stylistic unities predicted by either the
one- or two-author hypotheses, we will not find them. Style is
defined in a rigorous and quantitative way and applied using
computational techniques unimaginable certainly to Jerome and perhaps
even to Foucault, but conceptually it is Jerome's insight that
guides the work in the following chapter.

[^1]: In contrast with contemporary scholars, the twelfth-century
decretists tended to subsume the question of the biography of the
author under the question of authority. The purpose of the authority
section of this chapter is to propose that most of the medieval
statements that modern historians take as evidence about the biography
of the author or the authorship of the text are really statements
about the *authority* of either Gratian or the *Decretum*.

    In November 2014, I reported on work in progress at an event
    hosted by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities
    (MITH). I explained the project in simplified terms for a
    non-medievalist audience as an attempt to use computational
    methods to resolve a long-standing debate between two leading
    figures in the field, Pennington and Winroth, over whether
    Gratian's *Decretum* was written by one author or two. I then
    shared the finding that the results of principal component
    analysis of the *dicta* were not compatible with either the
    one-author or the two-author hypothesis. Neil Fraistat, the
    director of MITH, observed: "if the answer doesn't make sense,
    you're asking the wrong question." The authorship section of
    this chapter is my attempt to respond to Fraistat's observation
    by identifying as specifically as possible the way in which the
    "wrong question" has been asked about the authorship of the
    *Decretum*.

[^20]: "In the first recension, Gratian I both collected authoritative
texts and commented upon them, as did Peter Lombard in his roughly
contemporary *Sentences*. Both texts were written to meet the need
for a basic text-book in the teaching of their respective disciplines.
Other fields, such as Roman law, medicine, and biblical studies,
already possessed authoritative texts which could serve as the basis
for the teacher's commentary and interpretation. Gratian I and the
Lombard were in effect forced to create their own authoritative
texts (their authority deriving from the fact that they consisted
mainly of quotations) to be able effectively to teach their subjects.
When they did this, they had no reason to separate text from
commentary. They could not have suspected that their texts would
become standard school-texts, nor did they know that it later would
become common to keep text and commentary separate. Could they ever
have guessed how great the growth of their subjects would be after
their deaths? In their works, we can observe teachers creating tools
for their own teaching when there were as yet no standard forms for
academic texts in their subjects. The development of glosses,
*summae*, *questiones*, *distinctiones*, etc., came later, as did
the awareness of teachers like Bernard of Pavia that their compilations
might become standard school-texts (and, hence, that comments were

for them.

[^23]: See @kuttner_father_1941. Gratian implemented the hermeneutical
program for harmonizing apparently discordant canons outlined in
Ivo of Chartres's *Prologue*. Kuttner argues, though, that Gratian
applied Ivo's program as it had been developed in the intervening
forty years by scholastic theology, most notably by Abelard, and
not in its original form: scholastic theology inherited the program
from Ivo, Gratian inherited it in modified form from scholastic
theology. See also @luscombe_abelard_1969; and @winroth_where_2013

to an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the *Decretum*,

and of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript
was produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription
as independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian
and Saints Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible
that it predates Odofredus.

Somerville went on to have unusually influential academic careers

methodology and terminology, as they have been codified from the
late nineteenth century on." @winroth_where_2013 [106].

[^28]: Southern takes an extreme position with respect to Gratian's
teaching career, citing, as late as 1995, Gratian's supposed
association with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that
he had never been a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death
affirmed that Gratian was a Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian
Order, a small Italian branch of the Benedictines, which combined
austerity of life with considerable freedom to contribute to the
work of the Church in a wide variety of ways. This is what Gratian
did. He engaged in a very un-monastic branch of study, and produced
a law book which became the most widely distributed and probably
most generally used of all the masterpieces of twelfth-century
learning." "the book, and not the teaching of pupils, was the
offering Gratian's monastic life brought to the Church."

between the first and second recension with respect to the use of
Roman law within a broader context: "The argument about two authors
is based on textual (you could almost say literary) analysis:
formulations, practices of organization, source use, etc. Justinian's
Roman law books [are] really the only category of source only used
in one of the two recensions. I used to think that there were other
sources, such as 3L, that were only used in the second recension,
but this turned out to be an accident of the specific sections I
used as case studies (C. 24 and C.11 q.3)." (Anders Winroth, email
to Paul Evans, 18 May 2021).

[^40]: See @winroth_making_1996 [345], where he appears open to the
possibility that D.63 d.p.c.34 is an interpolation, without committing
to it. Winroth ultimately accepted the argument of Rudolf Weigand
(†1998) that the interpolation hypothesis is a slippery slope---once
you start rejecting problematic passages because they are inconvenient
(chronologically or otherwise), there is no obvious place at which
to stop.

[^41]: See @larson_early_2007, along with Winroth's rebuttal in
@winroth_innocent_2008.

[^43]: Much of the debate over whether the *Decretum* was the result
of a continuous or discontinuous process of composition has focused
on the Sankt Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript. Pennington,
Eichbauer, and Larson have argued that it represents, at some unknown
number of removes, an earlier version of the *Decretum* than Winroth's
first recension. Winroth and Wei have argued that Sg is a relatively
uninteresting abbreviation of a first recension manuscript with
some second recension interpolations. See @eichbauer_gratians_2013
for a good recent overview of these debates.

    The version of the *Decretum* preserved in the Sg manuscript
    contains somewhat fewer that 1,050 canons ("poco menos de 1,050
    *auctoritates* y en torno a los 650 *dicta*.")
    @larrainzar_borrador_1999 [601]. 1,050 is an approximation, not
    an exact count. Sg is therefore considerably shorter than either
    the first recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945)
    versions of the text. "The second recension contains 3,945
    canons (including the paleae) in the editions. The first recension
    contains only 1,860 canons (47 percent)." @winroth_making_2000
    [122]. 3,945 is a conventional number.

    Formally, Sg is not divided into parts; all of its content is
    presented in the form of cases. The first case, however, is
    unique to Sg and is referred to as *Causa Prima* to distinguish
    it from the *Causa* I found in all other pre-vulgate and vulgate
    versions of the *Decretum*. (*Causa* I appears as *Causa* II
    in Sg.) It contains a subset of canons and *dicta* found in
    Part I of the first recension and the vulgate, presented in
    almost exactly the same order in which they appear in those
    versions of the *Decretum*. (There is one relatively minor
    exception with respect to the ordering of the texts: the four
    canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7 are inserted
    between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31 c.7.)
    @larrainzar_borrador_1999 [653]. Notably, *Causa Prima* contains
    no texts (canons or *dicta*) from the *tractatus de legibus*
    (distinctions 1-20) and none from Gratian's "epilogue" (distinctions
    81-101).

[^46]: See @larson_early_2007. Pennington asserts that "[t]he main
reason that Winroth created a second 'Gratian' is because of a text
[D.63 d.p.c.34] that is found in all pre-Vulgate manuscripts."
@pennington_biography_2018 [362]. D.63 d.p.c.34 *is* central to
Winroth's arguments in favor of a late date for the first recension
(1139), and for a short teaching career for Gratian, but is not
relevant to his argument in favor of the two-author hypothesis.
"The reference to Lateran II only proves that the *Decretum*, as
transmitted by extant manuscripts (and I have checked several dozens,
'vulgate' as well as 'pre-vulgate'), cannot have been written before
1139." (Anders Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May 2021). As noted
in Chapter 2 and the footnote above, the original basis for Winroth's
two-author hypothesis was that the second recension makes much more
sophisticated use of Roman law concepts and terminology than the
first recension.

[^53]: "The final problem with this entry in the Sienese necrology
is that if this is the Gratian who compiled one of the most famous
textbooks of the twelfth century and who taught canon law at Bologna
for a long time, can we believe that he would have been given such
a modest entry?" @pennington_biography_2018 [387]

[^55]: @odonnell_augustine_2005 [136, 139]. The need for scribal
or secretarial support presupposes that authors create texts by
dictating them.

[^57]: Monastic modes of text production were gradually replaced
by commercial ones, e.g., around the University of Paris. See
@rouse_manuscripts_2000.

[^59]: The quasi-monastic model of text production leaves open a
range of possibilities. Those who have read the *Vita Augustini*
written by Possidius of Calama († c.437) are likely to be unimpressed
by the intellectual caliber of Augustine's episcopal household and
to assess its contribution to his work accordingly. Peter Brown
indirectly refers to the absence of classical education among members
of Augustine's "monastery" when he characterizes them as "younger
men, whose tastes, culture, and past history did not resemble that
of Augustine and his friends." @brown_augustine_1967 [143].

tituli inscriptione vel scripturae ipsius corruptione fallamur ...
Unde fidelissimus scriptor et veracissimus interpres Hieronymus ...
nos praemonuit.*" @abelard_sic_1977 [91]. "We must also be very
careful not to be deceived by a false attribution of authorship or
by a corrupt text ... Jerome, that most reliable writer and most
faithful translator, has given us forewarning of this."
@abelard_prologue_1988 [89].

[^70]: @foucault_what_1998 [214]. Foucault claims to have derived
the four criteria for determining whether a given "discursive set"
has one or several authors from Jerome's *De Viris illustribus*.
He provides, however, no citations. Walzer and Inabinet indicate
that "similar principles" can be found in @hulley_principles_1944
[105-109]. @walzer_who_2011 [188]. The section of Hulley's article
on "various points pertinent to questions of authorship" is in fact
almost certainly the ultimate source for Foucault's four criteria,
and provides citations to many works by Jerome (not just *De Viris
illustribus*) relevant to the question of determining the authorship
of a text or texts.

[^72]: When I first encountered Gratian's unexpected use of *sibi*
in C.3 d.init., I assumed that I was misconstruing the grammar.
Soon thereafter, however, I came across @dillon_case_2006 [316n42],
confirming that Gratian's use of *sibi* is in fact incorrect by the
standards of Classical Latin. This usage is not unique to Gratian;
Dillon referred me to @sidwell_reading_1995 [365-366], which discusses
ways in which the use of demonstratives and pronouns in Medieval
Latin differs from their use in Classical Latin.

    Thanks to Anders Winroth, who pointed out that C.29 d.init.
    contains a similar construction. @noonan_catholic_1997 thoroughly
    discusses C.29 in the context of the canon law of marriage and
    consent. Noonan translates the sentence more idiomatically than
    I have done as "[h]er first choice at last arrived to seek her
    in marriage" @noonan_catholic_1997 [1189]
