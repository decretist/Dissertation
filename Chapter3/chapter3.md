  The third order of business then is to recount the history of
  efforts, from the *Summa Parisiensis* on, of legal scholars and
  historians to find the man behind the name Gratian. Here, you
  need to lay out the traditional evidence used for solving this
  puzzle. You are lucky that Noonan, Pennington etc. have laid out
  the evidence and played with it for you.\

## Gratian

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself
is John T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian
slept here: The changing identity of the father of the systematic
study of canon law". Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating
that there is no sound historical basis for most of the affirmative
statements, for example that Gratian was a Camaldolese monk at the
monastery of SS. Felix and Nabor in Bologna, that many mid-twentieth
century handbooks and reference works presented as
commonplace.[@noonan_gratian_1979]

Very little is known about the historical Gratian, and almost
everything that previous generations thought was known about Gratian
has proved, on closer examination, to be myth.[@noonan_gratian_1979]
On the evidence found in the *Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been
less interested in contemporary ecclesiastical or secular politics
in general, and in the Investiture Controversy in particular, than
some modern scholars think he should have been. Gratian similarly
seems, based on the relatively limited use he makes in the *Decretum*
of material from the *Codex* and *Digest* of Justinian, to have
been either less interested in, or less aware of, the revival of
the study of Roman law in the early twelfth century than we think
he should have been. On the other hand, he seems to have been more
aware of, and more interested in, the emergence of scholastic
theology in northern France than we can easily explain.[^3]

[^3]: See [@kuttner_father_1941]. Kuttner argues is that Gratian
applied Ivo's program as it had been developed in the intervening
forty years by scholastic theology, most notably by Abelard, not
in its original form: scholastic theology got the program from Ivo,
Gratian got it from scholastic theology. See also [@luscombe_abelard_1969].

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that
Gratian "was staying" (stabat) at the monastery of SS. Felice and
Nabor while working as a rubricator.[^a] Odofredus did not indicate the
basis for his statement that Gratian had been a resident of SS.
Felice and Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a monk. In
1758, Camaldolese scholars Mittarelli and Costadono discovered papal
privileges conferred in 1113 and 1153 identifying SS. Felice and
Nabor as Camaldolese, and inferred from them that the monastery --
and by extension Gratian himself -- had been Camaldolese during the
intervening years. The claim that Gratian had a connection to the
Camaldolese order attracted criticism in the eighteenth century,
and fell out of favor in the nineteenth century, but was put back
into circulation in the mid-twentieth century by Van Hove.

[^a]: Noonan identifies Odofredus as the source for associating
Gratian with SS. Felix and Nabor ([-@noonan_gratian_1979, 148]),
but cf. [@southern_scholastic_1995, 286n5]. Southern draws attention
to an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the *Decretum*,
Bibliothèque publique et universitaire, MS Lat. 60: *Anno domini
MCL a Gratiano S. Feliciani Bononiensis monacho editum*. Pennington
does not identify the manuscript as one known to date from the
twelfth century (see
[Gratianus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a242)
in Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists),
and of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript
was produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription
as independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian
and SS. Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible
that it predates Odofredus.

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and
the courtroom to the historical record. By Noonan's standards, the
statement of Odofredus -- hearsay, not attributed to a source, a
century after the fact -- is nothing more than legend.

### Pennington's argument

Pennington, depending on Eichbauer, argues that because the number
of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in both the
margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short (87 are missing
from Aa, and 62 are missing from Fd) of the number that would be
expected if they had been copied from a Vulgate *Decretum*, these
manuscripts represent an intermediate "next-to-last" stage in the
development of the *Decretum* text intermediate the pre-Vulgate and
Vulgate versions. Furthermore, the fact that the Lateran II canons
*are* present in this "next-to-last" stage undermines the argument
going back to Fransen and supported by Lenherr that the Lateran II
canons are a last-minute addition, and poorly if at all integrated
into the argument of the *Decretum*.[@pennington_biography_2014,
686]

### Gratian's teaching career

Evidence concerning Gratian's career as a teacher of canon law is
contradictory. Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum*
have seen it as a teaching text, both in the sense that its intended
use (or at least one of its intended uses) was as an introductory
textbook, and also in the sense that it reflected the author's
experience as a classroom teacher. On the one hand, the early
manuscript tradition for the *Decretum* displays enough variation,
even among the first-recension manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P, to
suggest that the text developed continuously over the span of, and
in parallel with, a relatively long teaching career --- almost
certainly a decade or more. On the other hand, Gratian's personal
obscurity is so profound --- Stephan Kuttner compared Gratian to
the anonymous builders of Gothic cathedrals[^5] --- as to suggest
a short, or even no, teaching career.[^6]

[^5]: "He is one of those deeply admirable men of pious modesty,
like the builders of the medieval cathedrals, whose person is hidden
and effaced completely behind their immortal works." [@kuttner_father_1941,
4].

[^6]: **Expand: Winroth argues for a short teaching career, Southern
agues for no teaching career.** R.W. Southern is the extreme outlier
in this regard, citing as late as 1995 Gratian's supposed association
with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that he had never
been a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death affirmed that
Gratian was a Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian Order, a small
Italian branch of the Benedictines, which combined austerity of
life with considerable freedom to contribute to the work of the
Church in a wide variety of ways. This is what Gratian did. He
engaged in a very un-monastic branch of study, and produced a law
book which became the most widely distributed and probably most
generally used of all the masterpieces of twelfth-century learning."
"the book, and not the teaching of pupils, was the offering Gratian's
monastic life brought to the Church". [@southern_scholastic_1995,
286-287, 304]. Southern also asserts that no one claims to have
been Gratian's student --- "none of the earliest users of his work
claims to have been taught by him". "although other scholars made
some very early alterations and additions to the text of the
*Decretum*, none of them claimed to have been taught by him."
[@southern_scholastic_1995, 287, 304].

Considering the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the
author of the foundational textbook for the study of canon law in
the classical period, one of the truly stellar intellectual
achievements of the renaissance of the twelfth century, his complete
absence from the kinds of academic genealogies and origin stories
that Odofredus (†1265) handed down to his own Roman law students
is striking indeed.[^7]

[^7]: **Expand:** The tradition of Roman law teaching in Bologna
preserved an elaborate genealogy of masters and their students:
Pepo preceded Wernerius [Irnerius], who taught the Four Doctors.
Odofredus is an important source for this tradition, and his remarks
about Irnerius can be found in his commentary on *Dig.* 1.1.6.
Odofredus, *Lectura super Digesto veteri*, (2 volumes, Lyon:
1550-1552; repr. Bologna 1967-1968). For a short excerpt from the
Latin text with accompanying English translation, see
[@radding_origins_1988, 159-160] **See also Pennington "Big Bang".**
Note that Odofredus is also the source for associating Gratian with
the monastery of SS. Felix and Nabor. [@noonan_gratian_1979, 148].

We might be better able to assess Gratian's teaching career and how
it influenced the compilation and transmission of the *Decretum*
were we in a position to positively identify at least a few of his
students. Here again, however, the evidence is mixed at best. Three
twelfth-century canonist have, with varying degrees of plausibility,
been identified as having been students of Gratian: Paucapalea (fl.
1140s), Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179), Omnebene (d. 1185).

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early
period of the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's
immediate footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was
"[a] pupil of Gratian and the author of the first commentary on
the Decretum".[^8] But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea
does not refer to Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis
ipsa decreta sunt materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are
the subject matter of the master producing this work."[^9]

[^8]: Kenneth Pennington,
[Paucapalea](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a366),
*Bio-Bibliographic Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists.*

[^9]: [@paucapalea_summa_1890, 3] [@somerville_prefaces_1998, 184]
Indeed, based on a search through the OCR text layer of a PDF file
scanned from the Schulte edition and provided to me by Ken Pennington,
Paucapalea appears not to refer to Gratian by name anywhere in his
*summa*.

The omission is potentially significant. Prefaces to academic books
in the twelfth century formed a recognized genre with well-established
conventions. In an age resistant to any attempt by the human present
to appropriate the authority of the divine past, a commentator like
Paucapalea would have been expected to offer an explicit statement
in his preface affirming the authority of both the work commented
on and its author. If Paucapalea had had something to say about the
authority of Gratian, his readers would have expected him to do so
in his preface. That he did not suggests that he may not have known
enough about Gratian to credibly do so.[^10]

[^10]: **Going to need a very heavyweight footnote here referencing
Minnis.** [@minnis_medieval_1988] [@hunt_introductions_1980]

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows
both that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work:
"*In extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine
domini atque baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat,
et in his suum tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the
dedication of churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism,
and also confirmation, and with these things concludes his treatise."[^11]

[^11]: [@paucapalea_summa_1890, 3] [@somerville_prefaces_1998, 184-185]

If Rambaud is correct, this indicates that Paucapalea was personally
unfamiliar with the author and his plan of work.

### Epilogue

By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the systematic study
of canon law had evolved in a direction of which its father Gratian
would probably not have approved, and which he may even have had
difficulty recognizing as the same practical or applied branch of
theology his own work presupposed it to be. After around 1190, the
attention of both academic and practicing canonists decisively
turned away from theological jurisprudence in the tradition of
Gratian, based on a rich collection of scriptural, patristic,
conciliar, and papal source texts, and towards a much more narrowly
circumscribed technical jurisprudence focused exclusively on
contemporary papal decretals.
