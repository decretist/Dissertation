  The third order of business then is to recount the history of
  efforts, from the _Summa Parisiensis_ on, of legal scholars and
  historians to find the man behind the name Gratian. Here, you
  need to lay out the traditional evidence used for solving this
  puzzle.  You are lucky that Noonan, Pennington etc. have laid out
  the evidence and played with it for you.\

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself
is John T. Noonan Jr.’s classic 1979 _Traditio_ article “Gratian
slept here: The changing identity of the father of the systematic
study of canon law”. Noonan’s approach is apophatic, demonstrating
that there is no sound historical basis for most of the affirmative
statements, for example that Gratian was a Camaldolese monk at the
monastery of SS. Felix and Nabor in Bologna, that many mid-twentieth
century handbooks and reference works presented as
commonplace.[@noonan_gratian_1979]

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that
Gratian "was staying" (stabat) at the monastery of SS. Felice and
Nabor while working as a rubricator. Odofredus did not indicate the
basis for his statement that Gratian had been a resident of SS.
Felice and Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a monk. In
1758, Camaldolese scholars Mittarelli and Costadono discovered papal
privileges conferred in 1113 and 1153 identifying SS. Felice and
Nabor as Camaldolese, and inferred from them that the monastery --
and by extension Gratian himself -- had been Camaldolese during the
intervening years. The claim that Gratian had a connection to the
Camaldolese order attracted criticism in the eighteenth century,
and fell out of favor in the nineteenth century, but was put back
into circulation in the mid-twentieth century by Van Hove.

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and
the courtroom to the historical record. By Noonan's standards, the
statement of Odofredus -- hearsay, not attributed to a source, a
century after the fact -- is nothing more than legend.

### Pennington's argument

Pennington, depending on Eichbauer, argues that because the number
of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in both the
margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short (87 are missing
from Aa, and 62 are missing from Fd) of the number that would be
expected if they had been copied from a Vulgate _Decretum_, these
manuscripts represent an intermediate "next-to-last" stage in the
development of the _Decretum_ text intermediate the pre-Vulgate and
Vulgate versions. Furthermore, the fact that the Lateran II canons
_are_ present in this "next-to-last" stage undermines the agument
going back to Fransen and supported by Lenherr that the Lateran II
canons are a last-minute addition, and poorly if at all integrated
into the argument of the _Decretum_.[@pennington_biography_2014,
