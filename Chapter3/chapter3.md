abstract: |
  The third order of business then is to recount the history of
  efforts, from the *Summa Parisiensis* on, of legal scholars and
  historians to find the man behind the name Gratian. Here, you
  need to lay out the traditional evidence used for solving this
  puzzle. You are lucky that Noonan, Pennington etc. have laid out
  the evidence and played with it for you.\

## Gratian

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself
is John T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian
slept here: The changing identity of the father of the systematic
study of canon law". Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating
that there is no sound historical basis for most of the affirmative
statements, for example that Gratian was a Camaldolese monk at the
monastery of SS. Felix and Nabor in Bologna, that many mid-twentieth
century handbooks and reference works presented as
commonplace.[@noonan_gratian_1979]

Very little is known about the historical Gratian, and almost
everything that previous generations thought was known about Gratian
has proved, on closer examination, to be myth.[@noonan_gratian_1979]
On the evidence found in the *Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been
less interested in contemporary ecclesiastical or secular politics
in general, and in the Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) in
particular, than some modern scholars think he should have been.
Gratian similarly seems, based on the relatively limited use he
makes in the *Decretum* of material from the *Codex* and *Digest*
of Justinian, to have been either less interested in, or less aware
of, the revival of the study of Roman law in the early twelfth
century than we think he should have been. On the other hand, he
seems to have been more aware of, and more interested in, the
emergence of scholastic theology in northern France than we can
easily explain.[^3]

**You do not need to exhaustively catalog all of the Gratian myths
that Noonan debunked, one is enough. As an example of his approach
and conclusions, show how Noonan debunked one of the most prominent
elements of the mythology surrounding Gratian, the claim that Gratian
was a Camaldolese monk.**

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that
Gratian "was staying" (*stabat*) at the monastery of SS. Felice and
Nabor while working as a rubricator.[^4] Odofredus did not indicate
the basis for his statement that Gratian had been a resident of SS.
Felice and Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a monk. In
1758, Camaldolese scholars Mittarelli and Costadono discovered papal
privileges conferred in 1113 and 1153 identifying SS. Felice and
Nabor as Camaldolese, and inferred from them that the monastery---
and by extension Gratian himself---had been Camaldolese during the
intervening years. The claim that Gratian had a connection to the
Camaldolese order attracted criticism in the eighteenth century,
and fell out of favor in the nineteenth century, but was put back
into circulation in the mid-twentieth century by Van Hove.[^5]

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and
the courtroom to the historical record. **Noonan relied heavily
on the legal hearsay standard as understood and applied by
twentieth-century American courts of law as the basis for his
debunking of much Gratian mythology.** By Noonan's standards, the
statement of Odofredus---hearsay, not attributed to a source, a
century after the fact---is nothing more than legend. **Winroth,
however, has questioned whether this is an appropriate standard for
evaluating historical evidence.**

> To conclude, we have reason to believe that Gratian composed and
commented upon a substantial portion of the Concordia. In such
composition and commentary he revealed himself to be a teacher with
theological knowledge and interests and a lawyer's point of view.
He worked in Bologna in the 1130s and 1140s. Beyond these conclusions,
we have unverified hearsay, palpable legend, and the silent figure
in the shadows of S. Marco.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 172]

**Transition: Noonan wrote before the discover of the first recension;
recent (post-1996) discussion of the identity of Gratian necessarily
focus on accounting for the existence of the first and second
recensions.**

### Winroth's argument

(**Pennington's argument is largely a response to Winroth's, discuss
Winroth's argument first, followed by Pennington's critique of and
response to it.**)

"In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore chosen
to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the author
of the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not intended
to suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have been the
same person."[@winroth_making_2000, 122]

Winroth's arguments in chapters 1-5 of *The Making of Gratian's
Decretum* are agnostic as to whether Gratian 1 is the same person
as Gratian 2. The question of authorial identity is not relevant
to the primary argument that Winroth advances in those chapters,
which is that the Admont, Barcelona, and Florence manuscripts
represent a coherent first recension of the *Decretum* rather than
an abbreviation. In chapter 6 and in his conclusion, however, Winroth
observes that the second recension reflects a considerably more
sophisticated legal culture than that reflected in the first
recension, notably in the reception of concepts and terminology
from the study of Roman law, and argues that it is unlikely that
one author underwent such an intellectual evolution in a single
generation.

Fourteenth International Congress of Medieval Canon Law, Toronto,
2012.[@winroth_where_2013]

Winroth interprets an entry in a Siena necrology (Siena, Biblioteca
communale degli Intronati F12, f.5r) as evidence that Gratian died
as bishop of Chiusi on the feast day of St Lawrence (August 10) in
either 1144 or 1145.

### Pennington's argument

Pennington builds on Larson's conjecture that the canon referred
to at D.63 d.p.c.34 in the first recension and later incorporated
as D.63 c.35 in the second recension is not canon 28 from the Second
Lateran Council (1139), but rather a canon from an earlier council
or synod convened by Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was restated
at Lateran II (a common practice in the early twelfth century).
Pennington supports Larson's conjecture by noting that the text of
the canon as it appears in the *Decretum* includes variants (*facta
fuerit* vs *fuerit celebrata*, and *consensus* vs *assensus*) found
in none of the twenty manuscript witnesses to the Lateran II canons
edited by Martin Brett.[@pennington_biography_2018, 365]

Pennington, depending on Eichbauer, argues that because the number
of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in both the
margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short of the number
that would be expected if they had been copied from a Vulgate
*Decretum* (87 are missing from Aa, and 62 are missing from Fd),
these manuscripts represent an intermediate "next-to-last" stage
in the development of the *Decretum* text intermediate the pre-Vulgate
and Vulgate versions. Furthermore, the fact that the Lateran II
canons *are* present in this "next-to-last" stage undermines the
argument going back to Fransen and supported by Lenherr that the
Lateran II canons are a last-minute addition, and poorly if at all
integrated into the argument of the *Decretum*.[@pennington_biography_2018,
367-368]

### Gratian's teaching career

Evidence concerning Gratian's career as a teacher of canon law is
contradictory. Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum*
have seen it as a teaching text, both in the sense that its intended
use (or at least one of its intended uses) was as an introductory
textbook, and also in the sense that it reflected the author's
experience as a classroom teacher. On the one hand, the early
manuscript tradition for the *Decretum* displays enough variation,
even among the first-recension manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P, to
suggest that the text developed continuously over the span of, and
in parallel with, a relatively long teaching career---perhaps a
decade or more. On the other hand, Gratian's personal obscurity is
so profound---Stephan Kuttner compared Gratian to the anonymous
builders of Gothic cathedrals[^7]---as to suggest a short, or
even no, teaching career.[^8]

Considering the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the
author of the foundational textbook for the study of canon law in
the classical period, one of the truly stellar intellectual
achievements of the renaissance of the twelfth century, his complete
absence from the kinds of academic genealogies and origin stories
that Odofredus (†1265) handed down to his own Roman law students
is striking indeed.[^9]

We might be better able to assess Gratian's teaching career and how
it influenced the compilation and transmission of the *Decretum*
were we in a position to positively identify at least a few of his
students. Here again, however, the evidence is mixed at best. Three
twelfth-century canonist have, with varying degrees of plausibility,
been identified as having been students of Gratian: Paucapalea (fl.
1140s), Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179), Omnebene (d. 1185).

#### Paucapalea

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early
period of the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's
immediate footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was
"[a] pupil of Gratian and the author of the first commentary on
the Decretum".[^10] But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea
does not refer to Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis
ipsa decreta sunt materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are
the subject matter of the master producing this work."[^11]

The omission is potentially significant. Prefaces to academic books
in the twelfth century formed a recognized genre with well-established
conventions. In an age resistant to any attempt by the human present
to appropriate the authority of the divinely-inspired past, a
commentator like Paucapalea would have been expected to offer an
explicit statement in his preface affirming the authority of both
the work commented on and its author. If Paucapalea had had something
to say about the authority of Gratian, his readers would have
expected him to do so in his preface. That he did not suggests that
he may not have known enough about Gratian to credibly do so.[^12]

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows
both that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work:
"*In extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine
domini atque baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat,
et in his suum tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the
dedication of churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism,
and also confirmation, and with these things concludes his
treatise."[^13]

If Rambaud is correct that *de Consecratione* was not part of the
original *Decretum*, the fact that Paucapalea attributed it to the
same unnamed master responsible for rest of the text on which he
was commenting strongly suggests that he did not have direct knowledge
of Gratian or his plan of work.

#### Omnibonus or Omnebene

Omnibonus or Omnebene (d.1185) composed an abbreviation (*summa*?
abridged version?) of the *Decretum* in the 1150s.[^o] The basis
for the claim that Omnebene was a student of Gratian is an entry
for the year 1130 in the chronicle of Norman monk Robert of Torigni
(†1186)

> *Gratianus episcopus Clusinus coadunavit decreta valde utilia ex
decretis, canonibus, doctoribus, legibus Romanis, sufficientia ad
omnes ecclesiasticas causas decidendas, que frequentantur in curia
Romana et in aliis curiis ecclesiasticis. Hec postmodum abbreviavit
magister Omnebonum episcopus Veronensis, qui fuerat eius discipulus.*
(Gratian bishop of Chiusi brought together very useful decrees out
of decrees, canons, doctors, Roman laws, sufficient for deciding
all ecclesiastical cases, which are resorted to at the Roman curia
and in other ecclesiastical courts. Master Omnebonum bishop of
Verona, who had been his student, afterwards abbreviated them.)[^14]

Although the evidence of Robert's chronicle is by Noonan's standard
hearsay, Robert's reputation as a well-informed source concerning
Gratian has improved in recent years since the Siena necrology has
made the identification of Gratian as bishop of Chiusi more probable.

The dates do not preclude Omnebene's having been a student of
Gratian. Although Omnebene lived into the 1180s, the abbreviation
itself seems to date from the 1150s, perhaps a decade after the end
of whatever teaching career Gratian may have had, and at precisely
the moment that continent-wide interest in the text was increasing
most rapidly.

**Is there any internal evidence in Omnebene's abbreviation that
Gratian was his teacher? Cite recent editions of Omnebene's
abbreviation.**

#### Simon of Bisignano

Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179) was the author of a *Summa
decretorum* dated c.1177-79, and a number of glosses on the *Decretum*
are attributed to him.[^15] The evidence that Simon of Bisignano
was a student of Gratian’s comes from references within his
writings.[^16] Simon refers to himself as *discipulus* and to Gratian
as *magister* in at least two places in his *Summa* (**Landau says
"frequently"**). There is, however a hiatus of almost four decades
between the latest plausible date for the end of Gratian's teaching
career, and the documentary evidence we have for Simon's professional
career as a canonist. Although it is not chronologically impossible
for Simon to have been Gratian's student, it seems more likely that
he described himself as *discipulus* in something like the same
sense that we might describe contemporary scholars like Chodorow,
Pennington, and Winroth as "students of Gratian".

### Epilogue

By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the systematic study
of canon law had evolved in a direction of which its father Gratian
would probably not have approved, and which he may even have had
difficulty recognizing as the same practical or applied branch of
theology his own work presupposed it to be. After around 1190, the
attention of both academic and practicing canonists decisively
turned away from theological jurisprudence in the tradition of
Gratian, based on a rich collection of scriptural, patristic,
conciliar, and papal source texts, and towards a much more narrowly
circumscribed technical jurisprudence focused exclusively on
contemporary papal decretals.

[^3]: See [@kuttner_father_1941]. Kuttner argues that Gratian applied
Ivo's program as it had been developed in the intervening forty
years by scholastic theology, most notably by Abelard, and not in
its original form: scholastic theology got the program from Ivo,
Gratian got it from scholastic theology. See also [@luscombe_abelard_1969]
and [@winroth_where_2013, 111

[^4]: Noonan identifies Odofredus as the source for associating
Gratian with SS. Felix and Nabor (@noonan_gratian_1979, 148),
but cf. @southern_scholastic_1995, 286n5. Southern draws attention
to an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the *Decretum*,
Bibliothèque publique et universitaire, MS Lat. 60: *Anno domini
MCL a Gratiano S. Feliciani Bononiensis monacho editum*. Pennington
does not identify the manuscript as one known to date from the
twelfth century (see Kenneth Pennington,
[Gratianus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a242),
*Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists*),
and of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript
was produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription
as independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian
and SS. Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible
that it predates Odofredus.

@van_hove_prolegomena_1945.** Van Hove's *Prolegomena* had an
outsized impact on the trajectory of medieval canon law studies in
twentieth century North America because of its having been used by
the 1964 Yale seminar led by Peter Landau in the absence of Stephan
Kuttner, who was undergoing treatment for cancer at the time. Seminar
participants including Charles Donahue and Robert Somerville went
on to have unusually influential academic careers in the field
(Donahue at Harvard, and Somerville at Columbia where he was Winroth's
dissertation advisor).

like the builders of the medieval cathedrals, whose person is hidden
and effaced completely behind their immortal works." [@kuttner_father_1941,
4].

[^8]: **Expand: Winroth argues for a short teaching career, Southern
agues for no teaching career.** R.W. Southern is the extreme outlier
in this regard, citing as late as 1995 Gratian's supposed association
with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that he had never
been a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death affirmed that
Gratian was a Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian Order, a small
Italian branch of the Benedictines, which combined austerity of
life with considerable freedom to contribute to the work of the
Church in a wide variety of ways. This is what Gratian did. He
engaged in a very un-monastic branch of study, and produced a law
book which became the most widely distributed and probably most
generally used of all the masterpieces of twelfth-century learning."
"the book, and not the teaching of pupils, was the offering Gratian's
monastic life brought to the Church". [@southern_scholastic_1995,
286-287, 304]. Southern also asserts that no one claims to have
been Gratian's student---"none of the earliest users of his work
claims to have been taught by him". "although other scholars made
some very early alterations and additions to the text of the
*Decretum*, none of them claimed to have been taught by him."
[@southern_scholastic_1995, 287, 304]. **Does Southern provide
footnotes to support these statements?**

[^9]: **Expand:** The tradition of Roman law teaching in Bologna
preserved an elaborate genealogy of masters and their students:
Pepo preceded Wernerius [Irnerius], who taught the Four Doctors.
Odofredus is an important source for this tradition, and his remarks
about Irnerius can be found in his commentary on *Dig.* 1.1.6.
Odofredus, *Lectura super Digesto veteri*, (2 volumes, Lyon:
1550-1552; repr. Bologna 1967-1968). For a short excerpt from the
Latin text with accompanying English translation, see

the monastery of SS. Felix and Nabor. [@noonan_gratian_1979, 148].

    <Q.II> § *Sequitur secunda questio*  
    Sacram et authenticam pie recordationis Gratianus de matrimonio
    distinctionem composuit, quam quidam inanis glorie aucupes
    fecere bifrontem et simplicium potibus inuidentes more seuorum
    animalium aquas limpidas turbauerunt. Gratianus uero, canonum
    habita notitia et mente perspecta, dixit inter sponsum et sponsam
    esse matrimonium, sed initiatum; inter uirum et uxorem consummatum.
    Sed quoniam non est discipulus super magistrum nec debet securis
    contra eum qui secat gloriari timemus os nostrum in celum mittere
    et eum reprehendere cuius non sumus digni soluere corrigiam
    calceamenti.

    Note that the phrase "sed inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem"
    also occurs in Rufinus's treatment of the same question, C.27 q.2.
    [@rufinus_summa_1963, 440].

    Gratian of pious remembrance composed a sacred and *authenticam*
    distinction concerning marriage, *quam quidam inanis glorie
    aucupes fecere bifrontem* and not seeing with the drinks of the
    simple, [they] troubled clear waters in the manner of *seuorum*
    animals. But Gratian *habita notitia* of the canon and *mente
    perspecta*, said that matrimony is between spouse and spouse,
    but having been consecrated (*initiatum*), is consummated between
    husband and wife. But since the disciple is not above his master
    (Matthew 10:24, Luke 6:40), and the axe (*securis*) ought not
    boast (*gloriari*) against him who cuts (*secat*) (Isaiah 10:15),
    we fear to send our mouth into heaven (Psalm 72:9?) and to find
    fault with him the string (*corrigiam*) of whose shoes we are
    not worthy to loosen (John 1:27) (PLE).

    31. *Solet queri*  
    Quod quamuis Magister noster docuerit, nos tamen in hoc nolumus

    Although our master taught that, we nevertheless do not wish
    to imitate him in this (PLE).
