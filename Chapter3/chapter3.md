  The third order of business then is to recount the history of
  efforts, from the *Summa Parisiensis* on, of legal scholars and
  historians to find the man behind the name Gratian. Here, you
  need to lay out the traditional evidence used for solving this
  puzzle. You are lucky that Noonan, Pennington etc. have laid out
  the evidence and played with it for you.\

## Gratian

Very little is known about the historical Gratian, and almost
everything that previous generations thought was known about Gratian
has proved, on closer examination, to be myth.[@noonan_gratian_1979]
On the evidence found in the *Decretum*, Gratian seems to have been
less interested in contemporary ecclesiastical or secular politics
in general, and in the Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) in
particular, than some modern scholars think he ought to have been.
Gratian similarly seems, based on the relatively limited use he
makes in the *Decretum* of material from the *Codex* and *Digest*
of Justinian, to have been either less interested in, or less aware
of, the revival of the study of Roman law in the early twelfth
century than we think he ought to have been. On the other hand, he
seems to have been more aware of, and more interested in, the
emergence of scholastic theology in northern France than we can
easily explain.[^2]

### Noonan

The starting point for all modern scholarship on Gratian himself
is John T. Noonan Jr.'s classic 1979 *Traditio* article "Gratian
slept here: The changing identity of the father of the systematic
study of canon law". Noonan's approach is apophatic, demonstrating
that there is no sound historical basis for most of the affirmative
statements that many mid-twentieth century handbooks and reference
works presented as commonplace.[@noonan_gratian_1979] It is unnecessary
to exhaustively catalog all of the many Gratian myths that Noonan
debunked. A single example, his examination of the history of the
claim that Gratian was a Camaldolese monk at the monastery of Saints
Felix and Nabor in Bologna (one of the most prominent elements of
the mythology surrounding Gratian), is sufficient to illustrate the
nature of Noonan's method and conclusions.

Odofredus (†1265), a professor of law at Bologna, claimed that
Gratian "was staying" (*stabat*) at the monastery of Saints Felix
and Nabor while working as a rubricator.[^4] Odofredus did not
indicate the basis for his statement that Gratian had been a resident
of Saints Felix and Nabor, nor did he say that Gratian had been a
monk. In 1758, Camaldolese scholars Mittarelli and Costadono
discovered papal privileges conferred in 1113 and 1153 identifying
Saints Felix and Nabor as Camaldolese, and inferred from them that
the monastery---and by extension Gratian himself---had been Camaldolese
during the intervening years. The claim that Gratian had a connection
to the Camaldolese order attracted criticism in the eighteenth
century, and fell out of favor in the nineteenth century, but was
put back into circulation in the mid-twentieth century by Van
Hove.[^5]

Noonan (†2017) was a distinguished professor of law and an appellate
judge who applied the standards of evidence of the law school and
the courtroom to the historical record. Noonan relied heavily on
the legal hearsay standard as understood and applied by twentieth-century
American courts of law as the basis for his debunking of much Gratian
mythology. By Noonan's standards, the statement of Odofredus---hearsay,
not attributed to a source, a century after the fact---is nothing
more than legend.

Winroth has questioned whether this is an appropriate standard for
evaluating historical evidence.[^6] Noonan's insistence on adhering
to the courtroom rules of evidence can seem like overkill. If, after
all, the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor in Bologna was in the
hands of Camaldolese communities in 1113 and 1153, it does not seem
unreasonable to infer that it was in the hands of one in the 1120s
and 1130s when Gratian was putatively associated with the foundation,
whatever we think the nature of that association to have been. But
Noonan's caution seems justified when we consider, for example,
Southern's having seized upon the one thinly-sourced datum of the
Camaldolese connection as the foundation for his entire reconstruction
of Gratian's intentions and motivations in undertaking the *Decretum*
project, including a peremptory dismissal of any possibility that
Gratian had a teaching career.[^a]

Noonan did leave open one affirmative possibility, that a Gratian
who was recorded as having participated in an 1143 case in Venice
as one of three legal consultants ("Magister Walfredus", "Gratianus",
and "Moysis", in that order)[^b] advising a three-judge panel
presided over by a papal legate, Cardinal Goizo, might be the same
Gratian responsible for the *Decretum*.

> But we can say that it is possible, even plausible, that the
unbiased notary who recorded the scene at S. Marco is the only
person to have left an eyewitness account of Gratian.
[@noonan_gratian_1979, 171]

<!--
There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to be determined.
One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three distinctive parts,
with several distinctive sections within the parts, and these parts
have undergone editing as to chapter headings, chapter insertions,
and chapter order. Whatever the later formal ascription, is Gratian
responsible for all the parts? The other difficulty is the range of
roles the one 'responsible' person might have had [em-dash] compiler,
commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one or all? The
difficulties relate to each other, because evidence that Gratian
was, say, the commentator of Part II does not establish what role
he had in Part I. @noonan_gratian_1979, 162-163.
  -->
---

Noonan concludes that

> we have reason to believe that Gratian composed and commented
upon a substantial portion of the Concordia. In such composition
and commentary he revealed himself to be a teacher with theological
knowledge and interests and a lawyer's point of view.  He worked
in Bologna in the 1130s and 1140s. Beyond these conclusions, we
have unverified hearsay, palpable legend, and the silent figure in
the shadows of S. Marco.[@noonan_gratian_1979, 172]

This, then, is our starting point. Noonan wrote, however, before
Winroth's discovery of the first recension. Scholarship on the
identity of Gratian in this century has necessarily had to take
into account both Noonan's pruning of his biography and the existence
of the first and second recensions.

### Grebner

One of the earliest attempts to do so was Gundula Grebner's "Lay
patronate in Bologna in the first half of the 12th century: Regular
canons, notaries, and the *Decretum*."[@grebner_patronate_2007]
Grebner's article is usually cited in connection with the 1143 court
case: "Recently, Gundula Grebner uncovered more evidence that would
confirm Gratian's presence in a Venetian courtroom and change
Noonan's plausible to certain."[@pennington_biography_2018, 387]

<!-- Grebner's prosopographic analysis appears to put Gratian on
the "right" side of the Anacletian schism (i.e., on the same side
as Haimeric with the Innocentians).
  -->

### Winroth

Winroth's arguments in chapters 1-5 of *The Making of Gratian's
Decretum* are agnostic as to whether Gratian 1 is the same person
as Gratian 2.

> "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore
chosen to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the
author of the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not
intended to suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have
been the same person."[@winroth_making_2000, 122]

The question of authorial identity is not relevant to the primary
argument that Winroth advances in those chapters, which is that the
Admont, Barcelona, and Florence manuscripts represent a coherent
first recension of the *Decretum* rather than an abbreviation. In
chapter 6 and in his conclusion, however, Winroth observes that the
second recension reflects a considerably more sophisticated legal
culture than that reflected in the first recension, notably in the
reception of concepts and terminology from the study of Roman law,
and argues that it is unlikely that one author underwent such an
intellectual evolution in a single generation.[^9]

#### Sg

Much of the debate over whether the *Decretum* was the result of a
continuous or discontinuous process of composition focused on the
Sankt Gallen 673 (Sg) manuscript. Pennington and some of his students
have argued that it represented, at some unknown number of removes,
an earlier version of the *Decretum* than Winroth's first recension.
Winroth and Wei have argued that Sg was a relatively uninteresting
abbreviation of a first recension manuscript with some second
recension interpolations.[^sg1]

The version of the *Decretum* preserved in the Sankt Gallen
Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript contains somewhat fewer than
1,050 canons,[^sg2] and is therefore considerably shorter than
either the first recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945)
versions of the text.[^sg3] Formally, Sg is not divided into parts;
all of its content is presented in the form of cases. The first
case, however, is unique to Sg, and is referred to as *Causa Prima*
to distinguish it from the *Causa* I found in all other pre-vulgate
and vulgate versions of the *Decretum*. (*Causa* I appears as *Causa*
II in Sg.) It contains a subset of canons and *dicta* found in Part
I, presented in almost exactly the same order in which they appear
in other versions of the *Decretum*. (There is one relatively minor
exception with respect to the ordering of the texts, the four canons
corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7 are inserted between
the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.)[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653] Notably, *Causa Prima* contains
no texts (canons or *dicta*) from the *tractatus de legibus*
(distinctions 1-20) and none from Gratian's "epilogue" (distinctions
81-101).

[^sg1]: See @eichbauer_gratians_2013 for a good recent overview of
these debates.

[^sg2]: Carlos Larrainzar in -@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 601,
describes Sg as having "poco menos de 1,050 *auctoritates* y en
torno a los 650 *dicta*." "The second recension contains 3,945
canons (including the paleae) in the editions. The first recension
contains only 1,860 canons (47 percent)." @winroth_making_2000,
122.

[^sg3]: See @larrainzar_borrador_1999, 601, for the number of canons
in Sg, emphasizing that it is approximate. See @winroth_making_2000,
122, for the number of canons in the first recension. 3,945 is a
conventional number.

Winroth interprets an entry in a Siena necrology (Siena, Biblioteca
communale degli Intronati F12, f.5r) as evidence that Gratian died
as bishop of Chiusi on the feast day of St Lawrence (August 10) in
either 1144 or 1145.[^10]

### Pennington

Pennington builds on Larson's conjecture that the canon referred
to at D.63 d.p.c.34 in the first recension and later incorporated
as D.63 c.35 in the second recension is not canon 28 from the Second
Lateran Council (1139), but rather a canon from an earlier council
or synod convened by Innocent II at Rome in 1133 that was reissued,
a common practice in the early twelfth century, at Lateran II.[^11]
Pennington supports Larson's conjecture by noting that the text of
the canon as it appears in the *Decretum* includes variants (*facta
fuerit* vs *fuerit celebrata*, and *consensus* vs *assensus*) found
in none of the twenty manuscript witnesses to the Lateran II canons
edited by Martin Brett.[@pennington_biography_2018, 365] Pennington
argues that there is enough doubt as to whether D.63 d.p.c.34 refers
to canon 28 from Lateran II---as opposed to a canon from an earlier
council or synod later reissued with minor textual variations as
canon 28 at Lateran II---that it cannot be used as the sole or
primary basis for imposing a *terminus post quem* of 1139 on the
first recension of the *Decretum*.

Pennington, building on Eichbauer's findings, argues that because
the number of additional canons found in the margins of Bc, and in
both the margins and appendices of Fd and Aa, fall well short of
the number that would be expected if they had been copied from a
Vulgate *Decretum* (87 are missing from Aa, and 62 are missing from
Fd), these manuscripts represent an intermediate "next-to-last"
stage in the development of the *Decretum* text intermediate the
pre-Vulgate and Vulgate versions.[^13] Furthermore, the fact that
the Lateran II canons *are* present in this "next-to-last" stage
undermines the argument going back to Fransen and supported by
Lenherr that the Lateran II canons are a last-minute addition, and
poorly if at all integrated into the argument of the
*Decretum*.[@pennington_biography_2018, 367-368] **Pennington also
cites early manuscripts of the *Decretum* with 99 and 100 distinctions
in Part I as evidence for the continuous evolution of the text
between the first and second recensions.**

<!--
Pennington assumes an Iberian origin for Bc, but wasn't it originally
Italian?
  -->

Pennington's strongest argument in favor of his position on Sg is
not an abbreviation is that the unique *Causa Prima* (an ordered
subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension of
the *Decretum*) includes neither texts from the *tractatus de
legibus* (distinctions 1-20) nor from the "epilogue" (distinctions
81-101). Moreover, four cases, 24-26 and 28, are missing from Sg
entirely. Why, Pennington asks, would an abbreviator do this?

<!--
The subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension
of the *Decretum* from which *Causa Prima* in the Sg manuscript is
composed is ordered, with the relatively insignificant exception
that the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7
are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653]
  -->

There are two aspects to Pennington's reservations about identifying
the Gratian named in the Siena necrology with the author of the
*Decretum*. Pennington is open to the possibility that the author
of the *Decretum* eventually became a bishop somewhere, but questions
whether the person named in the necrology was either the bishop of
Chiusi, or the author of the *Decretum*. He notes that the necrology
refers to "Gratian of Chiusi, bishop", not to "Gratian, bishop of
Chiusi." His second reservation concerning the identification of
the Gratian mentioned in the Siena necrology as "the Gratian is
closely related to his reservation about Grebner's identification
of the Gratian mentioned in the record of the 1143 Venice court
case: neither record accords Gratian the kind of prominence that might
be expected for a figure of such importance. Gratian appears second on
the list of the three legal consultants in the Venice case, and is not referred
to with the honorific title "*Magister*." And the Siena necrology records
nothing beyond the bare facts of a name, a day (but not year) of death,
and that the defunct had been a bishop from or of Chiusi.

<!--
Pennington claims to be arguing that there was one Gratian, but is
in fact arguing that Gratian composed the *Decretum* incrementally
over the course of a teaching career spanning several decades, which
is not quite the same thing. Also, Pennington does not address
Winroth's content-based arguments in favor of the two-author
hypothesis (e.g., differences between the first and second recensions
in terms of the levels of sophistication in the use of Justinianic
Roman Law).
  -->

### Gratian's teaching career

Evidence concerning Gratian's career as a teacher of canon law is
contradictory. Most medieval and modern readers of the *Decretum*
have seen it as a teaching text, both in the sense that its intended
use (or at least one of its intended uses) was as an introductory
textbook, and also in the sense that it reflected the author's
experience as a classroom teacher. On the one hand, the early
manuscript tradition for the *Decretum* displays enough variation,
even among the first-recension manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P, to
suggest that the text developed continuously over the span of, and
in parallel with, a relatively long teaching career---perhaps a
decade or more. On the other hand, Gratian's personal obscurity is
so profound---Stephan Kuttner compared Gratian to the anonymous
builders of Gothic cathedrals[^15]---as to suggest a short, or even
no, teaching career.[^16]

Considering the fact that Gratian was universally credited as the
author of the foundational textbook for the study of canon law in
the classical period, one of the truly stellar intellectual
achievements of the renaissance of the twelfth century, his complete
absence from the kinds of academic genealogies and origin stories
that Odofredus (†1265) handed down to his own Roman law students
is striking indeed.[^17]

We might be better able to assess Gratian's teaching career and how
it influenced the compilation and transmission of the *Decretum*
were we in a position to positively identify at least a few of his
students. Here again, however, the evidence is mixed at best. Three
twelfth-century canonist have, with varying degrees of plausibility,
been identified as having been students of Gratian: Paucapalea (fl.
1140s), Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179), Omnebene (d. 1185).

#### Paucapalea

Paucapalea was easily the most prominent figure from the early
period of the Bolognese school of decretists who followed in Gratian's
immediate footsteps. Pennington flatly states that Paucapalea was
"[a] pupil of Gratian and the author of the first commentary on
the *Decretum*".[^18] But in the preface to that commentary, Paucapalea
does not refer to Gratian by name: "*Magistri autem hoc opus condentis
ipsa decreta sunt materia.* The decrees themselves, however, are
the subject matter of the master producing this work."[^19]

The omission is potentially significant. Prefaces to academic books
in the twelfth century formed a recognized genre with well-established
conventions. In an age resistant to any attempt by the human present
to appropriate the authority of the divinely-inspired past, a
commentator like Paucapalea would have been expected to offer an
explicit statement in his preface affirming the authority of both
the work commented on and its author. If Paucapalea had had something
to say about the authority of Gratian, his readers would have
expected him to do so in his preface. That he did not suggests that
he may not have known enough about Gratian to credibly do so.[^20]

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows
both that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work:
"*In extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine
domini atque baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat,
et in his suum tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the
dedication of churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism,
and also confirmation, and with these things concludes his
treatise."[^21]

If Rambaud is correct that *de Consecratione* was not part of the
original *Decretum*, the fact that Paucapalea attributed it to the
same unnamed master responsible for rest of the text on which he
was commenting strongly suggests that he did not have direct knowledge
of Gratian or his plan of work.

#### Omnibonus or Omnebene

Omnibonus or Omnebene (d.1185) composed an adaptation or transformation
of the *Decretum* in the 1150s.[^22] The basis for the claim that
Omnebene was a student of Gratian is an entry for the year 1130 in
the chronicle of Norman monk Robert of Torigni (†1186)

> *Gratianus episcopus Clusinus coadunavit decreta valde utilia ex
decretis, canonibus, doctoribus, legibus Romanis, sufficientia ad
omnes ecclesiasticas causas decidendas, que frequentantur in curia
Romana et in aliis curiis ecclesiasticis. Hec postmodum abbreviavit
magister Omnebonum episcopus Veronensis, qui fuerat eius discipulus.*
(Gratian bishop of Chiusi brought together very useful decrees out
of decrees, canons, doctors, Roman laws, sufficient for deciding
all ecclesiastical cases, which are resorted to at the Roman curia
and in other ecclesiastical courts. Master Omnebonum bishop of
Verona, who had been his student, afterwards abbreviated them.)[^23]

Although the evidence of Robert's chronicle is by Noonan's standard
hearsay, Robert's reputation as a well-informed source concerning
Gratian has improved in recent years since the Siena necrology has
made the identification of Gratian as bishop of Chiusi more probable.

The dates do not preclude Omnebene's having been a student of
Gratian. Although Omnebene lived into the 1180s, the adaptation
itself seems to date from around 1156, perhaps a decade and a half
after the end of whatever teaching career Gratian may have had, and
at precisely the moment that continent-wide interest in the text
was increasing most rapidly.[^24]

#### Simon of Bisignano

Simon of Bisignano (fl. 1174--1179) was the author of a *Summa
decretorum* dated c.1177-79, and a number of glosses on the *Decretum*
are attributed to him.[^25] The evidence that Simon of Bisignano
was a student of Gratian’s comes from references within his
writings.[^26] Simon refers to himself as *discipulus* and to Gratian
as *magister* in at least two places in his *Summa* (**Landau says
"frequently"**). There is, however a hiatus of almost four decades
between the latest plausible date for the end of Gratian's teaching
career, and the documentary evidence we have for Simon's professional
career as a canonist. Although it is not chronologically impossible
for Simon to have been Gratian's student, it seems more likely that
he described himself as *discipulus* in something like the same
sense that we might describe contemporary scholars like Chodorow,
Pennington, and Winroth as "students of Gratian".

### Epilogue

By the beginning of the thirteenth century, the systematic study
of canon law had evolved in a direction of which its father Gratian
would probably not have approved, and which he may even have had
difficulty recognizing as the same practical or applied branch of
theology his own work presupposed it to be. After around 1190, the
attention of both academic and practicing canonists decisively
turned away from theological jurisprudence in the tradition of
Gratian, based on a rich collection of scriptural, patristic,
conciliar, and papal source texts, and towards a much more narrowly
circumscribed technical jurisprudence focused exclusively on
contemporary papal decretals.

[^2]: See @kuttner_father_1941. Kuttner argues that Gratian applied
Ivo's program as it had been developed in the intervening forty
years by scholastic theology, most notably by Abelard, and not in
its original form: scholastic theology got the program from Ivo,
Gratian got it from scholastic theology. See also @luscombe_abelard_1969;
and @winroth_where_2013, 111.

[^4]: Noonan identifies Odofredus as the source for associating
Gratian with Saints Felix and Nabor. @noonan_gratian_1979, 148;
but cf. @southern_scholastic_1995, 286n5. Southern draws attention
to an inscription found in a Geneva manuscript of the *Decretum*,
Bibliothèque publique et universitaire, MS Lat. 60: *Anno domini
MCL a Gratiano S. Feliciani Bononiensis monacho editum*. Pennington
does not identify the manuscript as one known to date from the
twelfth century (see Kenneth Pennington,
[Gratianus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a242),
*Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists*),
and of course there is no way of knowing how long after the manuscript
was produced the inscription was added. The value of the inscription
as independent evidence attesting to a connection between Gratian
and Saints Felix and Nabor is therefore unknown, but it is possible
that it predates Odofredus.

[^5]: See @noonan_gratian_1979, 150-151. @van_hove_prolegomena_1945
had an outsized impact on the trajectory of medieval canon law
studies in twentieth century North America because of its having
been used by the 1964 Yale seminar led by Peter Landau in the absence
of Stephan Kuttner, who was undergoing treatment for cancer at the
time. Seminar participants including Charles Donahue and Robert
Somerville went on to have unusually influential academic careers
in the field (Donahue at Harvard, and Somerville at Columbia where
he was Winroth's dissertation advisor).

[^6]: "Noonan used sound historical methods, but he chose, as a
distinguished professor of law and later a prominent judge, to couch
his method in lawyerly terms, talking about hearsay and wanting to
cross-examine witnesses. To make any headway with as complex and
difficult a problem as Gratian's biography, it will be important
to cling a bit more closely than Noonan did to classical historical
methodology and terminology, as they have been codified from the
late nineteenth century on." @winroth_where_2013, 106.

[^a]: R.W. Southern takes an extreme position with respect to
Gratian's teaching career, citing as late as 1995 Gratian's supposed
association with the Camaldolese order to advance an argument that
he had never been a teacher: "Reliable writers after his death
affirmed that Gratian was a Benedictine monk of the Camaldolesian
Order, a small Italian branch of the Benedictines, which combined
austerity of life with considerable freedom to contribute to the
work of the Church in a wide variety of ways. This is what Gratian
did. He engaged in a very un-monastic branch of study, and produced
a law book which became the most widely distributed and probably
most generally used of all the masterpieces of twelfth-century
learning." "the book, and not the teaching of pupils, was the
offering Gratian's monastic life brought to the Church".
[@southern_scholastic_1995, 286-287, 304].

[^b]: Pennngton reads a great deal into the order (why wasn't Gratian
referred to first?) and the honorifics (why wasn't Gratian referred
to as "Magister"?). @pennington_biography_2018, 387-388. There is,
however, no reason to assume that the notary who reported on the
proceedings would necessarily have been well-informed about Gratian,
who was, after all, not a local figure in Venice.

[^9]: Winroth has since come to contextualize the differences between
the first and second recension with respect to the use of Roman law
within a broader context: "The argument about two authors is based
on textual (you could almost say literary) analysis: formulations,
practices of organization, source use, etc. Justinian’s Roman law
books is really the only category of source only used in one of the
two recensions. I used to think that there were other sources, such
as 3L, that were only used in the second recension, but this turned
out to be an accident of the specific sections I used as case studies
(C. 24 and C.11 q.3)." (Anders Winroth, email to Paul Evans, 18 May
2021).

[^10]: See @winroth_where_2013. The article expands on a presentation
given by Winroth at the Fourteenth International Congress of Medieval
Canon Law, Toronto, 2012.

[^11]: **Placeholder for Pennington, Larson footnote** Pennington
asserts that "[t]he main reason that Winroth created a second
'Gratian' is because of a text [D.63 d.p.c.34] that is found in all
pre-Vulgate manuscripts." @pennington_biography_2018, 362. D.63
d.p.c.34 *is* central to Winroth's arguments in favor of a late
date for the first recension (1139), and for a short teaching career
for Gratian, but is not relevant to his argument in favor of the
two-author hypothesis. "The reference to Lateran II only proves
that the *Decretum*, as transmitted by extant manuscripts (and I
have checked several dozens, 'vulgate' as well as 'pre-vulgate'),
cannot have been written before 1139." (Anders Winroth, email to
Paul Evans, 18 May 2021). As noted in Chapter 2 and the footnote
above, the original basis for Winroth's two-author hypothesis was
that the second recension makes much more sophisticated use of Roman
law concepts and terminology than the first recension.

[^16]: **Winroth argues for a short teaching career, Southern argues
for no teaching career.** Southern also asserts that no one claims
to have been Gratian's student---"none of the earliest users of his
work claims to have been taught by him". "although other scholars
made some very early alterations and additions to the text of the
*Decretum*, none of them claimed to have been taught by him."

Note that Odofredus is also the source for associating Gratian with
the monastery of Saints Felix and Nabor. [@noonan_gratian_1979,
148].

Indeed, based on a search through the OCR text layer of a PDF file
scanned from the Schulte edition and provided to me by Ken Pennington,
Paucapalea appears not to refer to Gratian by name anywhere in his
*summa*.

I was therefore unable to look for any internal evidence in Omnebene's

Pennington does not indicate that Simon of Bisignano was a student
of Gratian. Glosses attributed to Simon of Bisignano are indicated
by the *sigla* s., si., and sy. [@weigand_development_2008, 97]
**Simon's glosses are dated earlier than his *Summa* (cite Hartmann

[^26]: @kuttner_research_1990, 7. @noonan_gratian_1979, 157, rejects
this, but Kuttner disagrees. Simon of Bisignano refers to Gratian
as *magister* and to himself as *discipulus* in his comments on
C.27 q.2, @simon_of_bisignano_summa_2014, 412. Simon again refers
to Gratian as *magister* in his comments on D.4 c.31 of *de

    <CAVSA XXVII> <Q.II> § *Sequitur secunda questio* Sacram et
    authenticam pie recordationis Gratianus de matrimonio distinctionem
    composuit, quam quidam inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem
    et simplicium potibus inuidentes more seuorum animalium aquas
    limpidas turbauerunt. Gratianus uero, canonum habita notitia
    et mente perspecta, dixit inter sponsum et sponsam esse
    matrimonium, sed initiatum; inter uirum et uxorem consummatum.
    Sed quoniam non est discipulus super magistrum nec debet securis
    contra eum qui secat gloriari timemus os nostrum in celum mittere
    et eum reprehendere cuius non sumus digni soluere corrigiam
    calceamenti.

    Note that the phrase "sed inanis glorie aucupes fecere bifrontem"
    also occurs in Rufinus's treatment of the same question, C.27
    q.2. [@rufinus_summa_1963, 440].

    Gratian of pious remembrance composed a sacred and *authenticam*
    distinction concerning marriage, *quam quidam inanis glorie
    aucupes fecere bifrontem* and not seeing with the drinks of the
    simple, [they] troubled clear waters in the manner of *seuorum*
    animals. But Gratian *habita notitia* of the canon and *mente
    perspecta*, said that matrimony is between spouse and spouse,
    but having been consecrated (*initiatum*), is consummated between
    husband and wife. But since the disciple is not above his master
    (Matthew 10:24, Luke 6:40), and the axe (*securis*) ought not
    boast (*gloriari*) against him who cuts (*secat*) (Isaiah 10:15),
    we fear to send our mouth into heaven (Psalm 72:9?) and to find
    fault with him the string (*corrigiam*) of whose shoes we are
    not worthy to loosen (John 1:27) (PLE).

    <DISTINCTIO IIII> 31. *Solet queri* Quod quamuis Magister noster
    docuerit, nos tamen in hoc nolumus eum imitari.

    Although our master taught that, we nevertheless do not wish
    to imitate him in this (PLE).
