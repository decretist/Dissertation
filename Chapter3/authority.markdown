### Authority

In the middle ages, to presume to take on the role of *auctor* was to
make a claim (at least implicitly) to *auctoritas*. Medieval writers
were in general quite reticent about making claims to *auctoritas* on
their own behalf, and employed a variety of techniques to maintain
plausible deniability that they were in fact claiming authorship and the
authority that goes with it. Some repudiated the role of author
altogether and circulated the texts they wrote pseudonymously under the
name of a canonical author of unquestioned authority. Augustine was the
overwhelming favorite, and Gratian extensively quoted from a text, *De
vera et falsa penitentia*, that circulated under such false pretences in
his *de Penitentia*. Others sought to distance themselves from the role
of author by locating authority in texts they quoted rather than in the
original use they made of those quoted texts in their own writing
("their authority deriving mainly from the fact that they consisted
mostly of quotations" Winroth, *The Making of Gratian's Decretum*, 191).

The problem of authorship and authority was particularly acute in the
first half of the twelfth century, because early scholastic readers were
more alert to the chinks in the armor of traditional authorities than
their less-sophisticated predecessors had been. Peter Abelard was unique
in the radicalism of his solution to the problem: in *Sic et non*, he
subverted and indeed dissolved the entire notion of authority by showing
that texts written by equally authoritative authors were in actual, not
just apparent, disagreement.

Gratian, here defined as the authors of the first-recension *dicta*,
undertook the conservative hermeneutical project of harmonizing the
apparently discordant canons to the level of sophistication demanded by
a twelfth-century scholastic audience, and accordingly adopted the
strategy of locating authority in the texts that he quoted. It seems,
however, that the widespread reception of the *Decretum* as itself
authoritative was influenced by an accidental feature of the text. The
page layout of early manuscripts of the *Decretum*---the placement of
Gratian's *dicta* inline with the authorities rather on the
margins---had the unintentional effect of promoting Gratian himself to
the status of an authority (or at least to a status of near-equality
with the authorities). Even though the specific page layout was probably
adopted in the 1130s or 1140s for no particular reason other than that
the conventions for the various genres of the literature of canon law
had not yet been firmly established, readers in the 1150s and 1160s seem
to have understood it, at least implicitly, as an authority claim, a
claim that they were more than willing to accept.[1] This was almost
certainly an over-reading of the authority claim actually being made in
the *Decretum*. At most, there seems to have been a limited claim of
authority being made by the authors of the first-recension *dicta*
(Gratian 1) on behalf of their *magister*, the author of the case
statements (Gratian 0), whose harmonization of the canons was
authoritative for them.

In any event, the modern notion that the authority of a text derives
from the independently testable validity of the arguments it contains is
simply not relevant in the context of the twelfth century.

[1] "In the first recension, Gratian I both collected authoritative
texts and commented upon them, as did Peter Lombard in his roughly
contemporary *Sentences*. Both texts were written to meet the need for a
basic text-book in the teaching of their respective disciplines. Other
fields, such as Roman law, medicine, and biblical studies, already
possessed authoritative texts which could serve as the basis for the
teacher's commentary and interpretation. Gratian I and the Lombard were
in effect forced to create their own authoritative texts (their
authority deriving from the fact that they consisted mainly of
quotations) to be able effectively to teach their subjects. When they
did this, they had no reason to separate text from commentary. They
could not have suspected that their texts would become standard
school-texts, nor did they know that it later would become common to
keep text and commentary separate. Could they ever have guessed how
great the growth of their subjects would be after their deaths? In their
works, we can observe teachers creating tools for their own teaching
when there were as yet no standard forms for academic texts in their
subjects. The development of glosses, *summae*, *questiones*,
*distinctiones*, etc., came later, as did the awareness of teachers like
Bernard of Pavia that their compilations might become standard
school-texts (and, hence, that comments were best relegated to the
margins)." Anders Winroth, *The Making of Gratian’s Decretum*
