The last time we talked, I indicated that chapter 3 on Gratian was
the one non-technical chapter you have not yet reviewed. My thinking
on chapter 3 has evolved considerably over the last month, so I
wanted to update you, partly as a way to clarify my current view
of the problem for my own benefit.

When I started writing the non-technical chapters in June 2017, I
hesitated about whether to start with Gratian or with the *Decretum*.
I eventually decided that it would be better to start with the
*Decretum* than with Gratian since we know much more about the
*Decretum* than we do about Gratian, and most of what we do know
about Gratian, we know through the *Decretum* (quote John Wei). The
chapter that followed from the decision to start with the *Decretum*
is the one we read and discussed with the HIGR 295 participants in
November 2017.

The purpose of the Gratian chapter in the original dissertation
outline was limited and clearly defined: to show that there was no
information in the known biography of Gratian, either from modern
scholarship (Noonan, Grebner, Winroth, and Pennington) or from
evidence left by near-contemporaries (i.e, the authors of the
prefaces of 12th-century *summae* on the *Decretum*), that contradicted
or precluded the possibility that the case statements and *dicta*
had different authors. (quote Chodorow) To the extent that I intended
to review the evidence left by near-contemporaries, I was mainly
interested in the question of whether any of the decretist authors
of the prefaces to the *summae* suggested that they had been students
of Gratian or otherwise had first-hand knowledge of the circumstances
under which the *Decretum* had been compiled. The conclusion of the
first draft of the Gratian chapter was that no near-contemporary
makes an unambiguous claim to have been Gratian's student or to
otherwise have had first-hand knowledge of the circumstances under
which the *Decretum* was compiled, and that nothing in modern
scholarship precludes or contradicts the possibility that the
*Decretum* was a product of collective or group authorship.

From 2012 to 2014, I worked as a graduate research assistant for
the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at
the University of Maryland, one of the foremost centers for Digital
Humanities research in the US. In November 2014, I presented my
preliminary findings on the authorship of Gratian's *Decretum* to
a brown-bag seminar attended by members of the MITH staff, mostly
English and Information School faculty plus staff members holding
appointments in the UMD library system. As is quite common in the
Digital Humanities community, the primary academic expertise of the
faculty members present was in 19th-century English literature (for
example, Neil Fraistat, the director of MITH at the time, is a
leading authority on Keats, Shelley, and Byron). For the benefit
of the non-medievalist audience, I presented the problem I was
investigating in a simplified (though I believe not over-simplified)
form. Using a physical copy of the Friedberg edition of the *Decretum*
as a prop, I made the following points:

+ That the *Decretum* was a 12th-century university textbook for
the study of canon law, the law of the Roman Catholic church.

+ That the *Decretum* was written in Latin (I had reason to know
that that would not be obvious to this particular audience).

+ That the *Decretum* was the first book written primarily for use
as a university textbook.

+ That Anders Winroth had in 1996 identified four early manuscripts
as exemplars of a first recension of the *Decretum* about half the
length of the vulgate *Decretum* represented in the Friedberg
edition, and that therefore the *Decretum*, like many modern
university textbooks, could be thought of as having a first and
second edition (recension).

+ That as a consequence of the subject matter, the commentary
historically attributed to the putative author Gratian amounted to
only around one-fifth of the text of the vulgate *Decretum*, while
the remaining four-fifths of the text was quoted or excerpted from
traditionally accepted authorities such as conciliar decrees,
patristic writings, and papal letters (22% and 78% by word count
respectively). I pointed out the typographical distinction in the
Friedberg edition between the commentary (italic) and the authorities
(roman) as a visual illustration of relative proportion between the
two.

+ That the *Decretum* is divided into three parts, and that the
second part, consisting of 36 cases each introduced by a hypothetical
case statement is considered by many (cite Noonan and Pennington)
to be both uniquely innovative, and to be the core around which the
compilation developed.

I introduced the scholarly controversy over whether the commentary
historically attributed to Gratian had one author (as Pennington
argues) or two (as Winroth argues). I then presented my preliminary
finding that the case statements had *not* in fact been written by
the author(s) of the rest of the commentary historically attributed
to Gratian, and that the commentary excluding the case statement
could not be definitively attributed to either one or two authors.

Much of the discussion that followed concentrated on the technical
details of using the frequencies of function words to attribute
authorship and tool I was using to do so (the stylometry for R
package). Neil Fraistat, however, summarized the conversation with
a higher-level observation. Accepting the way in which the question
had been framed by specialists in the field of canon law, I had
designed an experiment intended to answer the question of whether
the commentary historically attributed to Gratian had one or two
authors. If the results of the experiment made no sense in the terms
of the question it was intended to answer, that, Fraistat suggested,
meant that the field was asking the wrong question.
