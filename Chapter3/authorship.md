## Authority

Modern scholars considering the authorship of a text are primarily
interested in the question of who wrote the exact words it contains
and whose thought is reflected in the arguments it makes. This
dissertation is about whether one, two, or many authors wrote the
exact words in the text of the *dicta* in the *Decretum*. The
medieval sources we depend on for much of our evidence about who
wrote the *Decretum* were not uninterested in the question of who
wrote the exact words in the text, but that question overlapped for
them in a way that it does not for us with the question of who was
the source of the text's authority. The question of the authority
of the *Decretum* therefore has to be considered separately from
that of authorship.

In the middle ages, to presume to take on the role of *auctor* was
to make a claim (at least implicitly) to *auctoritas*. Medieval
writers were in general quite reticent about making claims to
authority on their own behalf, and employed a variety of techniques
to maintain plausible deniability that they were in fact claiming
authorship and the authority that went with it. Some repudiated the
role of author altogether and circulated the texts they wrote
pseudonymously under the name of a canonical author of unquestioned
authority. Augustine was the overwhelming favorite, and Gratian
extensively quoted in his *de Penitentia* from a text, *De vera et
falsa penitentia*, that circulated under such false pretences.
Others sought to distance themselves from the role of author by
locating authority in texts they quoted rather than in the original
use they made of those quoted texts in their own writing.[^1] In
any event, the modern notion that the ultimate source for the
authority of a text is is an independent judgement by the reader
of the validity of the arguments it contains is simply not applicable
to the twelfth century.

The problem of authorship and authority was particularly acute in
the first half of the twelfth century, because early scholastic
readers were more alert to the chinks in the armor of traditional
authorities than their less-sophisticated predecessors had been.
Peter Abelard was unique in the radicalism of his solution to the
problem: in *Sic et non*, he subverted and indeed dissolved the
entire notion of authority by showing that texts written by equally
authoritative authors were in actual, not just apparent, disagreement.

Gratian undertook the conservative hermeneutical project of harmonizing
the apparently discordant canons to the level of sophistication
demanded by a twelfth-century scholastic audience, and accordingly
adopted the strategy of locating authority in the texts that he
quoted. It seems, however, that the widespread reception of the
*Decretum* as itself authoritative benefited from an accidental
feature of the text. The page layout of early manuscripts of the
*Decretum*---the placement of Gratian's *dicta* inline with the
authorities rather on the margins---had the unintentional effect
of promoting Gratian himself to the status of an authority (or at
least to a status of near-equality with his authorities). Even
though the specific page layout was probably adopted in the 1130s
or 1140s for no particular reason other than that the conventions
for the various genres of the literature of canon law had not yet
been firmly established, readers in the 1150s and 1160s seem to
have understood it, at least implicitly, as a claim to authority,
a claim that they were more than willing to accept.[^2] This was
almost certainly an over-reading of the authority claim actually
being made in the *Decretum*.[^3]

## Authorship

Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around
the figure of the author.[^4] Three examples from classical and
late antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which this requirement
could be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary ambitions with
the support of highly skilled but unfree labor purchased out of his
personal wealth, most famously his slave and later freedman Tiro.
A wealthy lay patron named Ambrose paid for the secretarial staff
that supported the authorial activities of Origen of Alexandria
(†253).[^5] Quasi-monastic members of the episcopal household of
Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided the scribal support that made
his prodigious authorial output possible. The mode of production
pioneered by Augustine and his household in which monastic labor
enabled the creation of original texts by their authors as well as
the subsequent copying and circulation of finished texts proved a
durable one, and predominated in the Latin West until the thirteenth
century.[^6]

Given the material and social technologies for authorship available
in the twelfth century, creation of a text the size of Gratian's
*Decretum* would necessarily have been a collaborative effort.
Pennington has noted that "Gratian may have had an atelier of
assistants,"[@pennington_biography_2018, 362] but that observation
suggests that the nature of the collaboration between Gratian and
those Pennington conceives of as his assistant needs to be examined
more closely. What substantive intellectual contributions, if any,
did Gratian's collaborators make to the project?[^8] There are a
number of indications, discussed in the previous chapter, that the
*Decretum* outgrew the ability of a single author to effectively
manage the development of the text. The question is whether Gratian's
partial loss of control of the project opened up a space for
genuinely collaborative authorship. The starting point for this inquiry
is a theoretically informed understanding of what authorship is.

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Grebner, Winroth, and
Pennington[^9] reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes
that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we will have
identified the author of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of
the first recension), with authorship of the text understood in a
way not unlike the way in which we might understand the authorship
of a modern literary text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept
of authorship, allowing for the possibility that there might have
been multiple authors.) In conducting this kind of "quest of the
historical Gratian," historians have uncritically accepted a
conceptualization of authorship that is somewhat anachronistic when
applied to a medieval text and has been largely discarded by literary
scholarship over the last half-century.

Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death of the Author" and Michel
Foucault's 1969 response "What Is an Author?" are foundational
readings in the theory of authorship.[^10]

### Barthes

"The Death of the Author" holds a place in literary studies somewhat
similar to the place that Noonan's "Gratian Slept Here" holds in
canon law studies---it is a clearing of the ground of older ways
of thinking in the field. Although the title of the essay was a
lightning-rod in 1980s theory war polemics, taken as if Barthes
were arguing that texts somehow wrote themselves, Medievalists will
recognize the French title of the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as
a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*. Barthes's essay is short and relatively
free of arcane technical terms. Barthes was a literary critic and
scholar making an argument to other literary critics and scholars
against the practice of close-reading literary texts with the focus
on the biographical and historical context of the author and its
relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the term "Author" to indicate the conceptualization
of authorship he is arguing against and the term "author" where he
intends to use the word in its more general and non-technical sense.
An Author is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a
literary text, and "is in the same relation of antecedence to his
work as a father to his child." [@barthes_death_1977, 145] Barthes
argues that authors cannot be Authors---no person or persons can
have a parent-child relationship to a text since all literary texts
are socially constructed: "The text is a tissue of quotations drawn
from the innumerable centres of culture." [@barthes_death_1977,
146]

**Gratian may be the author of the *dicta* but he is not their
Author. The *dicta* are socially constructed "tissue[s] of quotations
drawn from the innumerable centres of culture."**

The Barthes's central argument is against precisely the kind of
reading that is prevalent in scholarship on Gratian and the *Decretum*:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to
furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a
conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting
itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases:
society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author
has been found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.
[@barthes_death_1977, 147]

Barthes uses the term "scriptor" to indicate an alternative
conceptualization of authorship in which the performative aspect
of the author's act is the central focus. Barthes uses the terms
"criticism" and "critic" to refer respectively to the activity of
close-reading a literary text and one engaging in that activity.
Translating the terms as "reading" and "reader" would not be seriously
misleading. Gratian as author of the *dicta* is therefore, using
Barthes's definitions, both scriptor and critic. The *dicta* were
originally delivered in a classroom setting, and thus have both a
performative and a contemporaneous aspect ("there is no other time
than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written
*here* and *now*" [@barthes_death_1977, 145]) The *dicta* are also
the record of a particular close-reading of a selection of authoritative
texts.

### Foucault

Barthes's criticism of the idea of authorship is apophatic, concerned
mostly with what, in his view, authorship is not. Barthes warns
against the conceptualization of authorship, centered on the
biographical-historical context of the individual author, that most
historians (including those who have written about Gratian's
authorship of the *Decretum*) take for granted. In place of the
conceptualization of authorship rendered suspect by Barthes, Foucault
proposes the idea of the "author function." He starts by asking
"[w]hat is an author’s name? How does it function?"[@foucault_what_1998,
209] and then goes on to observe:

> ... if we proved that Shakespeare did not write those sonnets
which pass for his, that would constitute a significant change and
affect the manner in which the author's name functions. If we proved
that Shakespeare wrote Bacon's *Organon* by showing that the same
author wrote both the works of Bacon and those of Shakespeare, that
would ...  entirely modify the functioning of the author's
name.[@foucault_what_1998, 210]

Foucault has a reputation for the use of specialized vocabulary
(his critics would say jargon) in his writing that many historians
find objectionable. The specialized use of the term "author function"
is a case in point. The idea that he is attempting to convey,
however, is relatively straightforward. Abstract away the biographical
details about the author from the work that the *idea* of the author
does for us when we close-read a text, and what remains is the
author function. Ironically, given the rather avant-garde reputation
that is still attached to his name at least in the English-speaking
world, Foucault derives the substantive content of the idea of the
author function almost entirely from Jerome (†420).

> In *De Viris illustribus*, Saint Jerome explains that homonymy is not
sufficient to identify legitimately authors of more than one work:
different individuals could have had the same name, or one man could
have, illegitimately, borrowed another’s patronymic. The name as
an individual trademark is not enough when one works within a textual
tradition. [@foucault_what_1998, 214]

> How, then can one attribute several discourses to one and the same
author? How can one use the author function to determine if one is
dealing with one or several individuals? Saint Jerome proposes four
criteria:[^18]

> \(1\) if among several books attributed to an author one
is inferior to the others, it must be withdrawn from the list of
the author’s works (the author is therefore defined as a constant
level of value);

> \(2\) the same should be done if certain texts
contradict the doctrine expounded in the author’s other works (the
author is thus defined as a field of conceptual or theoretical
coherence);

> \(3\) one must also exclude works that are written in a
different style, containing words and expressions not ordinarily
found in the writer’s production;

> \(4\) finally, passages quoting
statements made or mentioning events that occurred after the author’s
death must be regarded as interpolated texts (the author is seen
as a historical figure at the crossroads of a certain number of
events). [@foucault_what_1998, 214]

Foucault's essay is a response to Barthes's.

Foucault's essay is more directly relevant than Barthes's to the
problems of authorship raised by Gratian's *Decretum*,

[^1]: "their authority deriving mainly from the fact that they
consisted mostly of quotations" @winroth_making_2000, 191.

[^2]: "In the first recension, Gratian I both collected authoritative
texts and commented upon them, as did Peter Lombard in his roughly
contemporary *Sentences*. Both texts were written to meet the need
for a basic text-book in the teaching of their respective disciplines.
Other fields, such as Roman law, medicine, and biblical studies,
already possessed authoritative texts which could serve as the basis
for the teacher's commentary and interpretation. Gratian I and the
Lombard were in effect forced to create their own authoritative
texts (their authority deriving from the fact that they consisted
mainly of quotations) to be able effectively to teach their subjects.
When they did this, they had no reason to separate text from
commentary. They could not have suspected that their texts would
become standard school-texts, nor did they know that it later would
become common to keep text and commentary separate. Could they ever
have guessed how great the growth of their subjects would be after
their deaths? In their works, we can observe teachers creating tools
for their own teaching when there were as yet no standard forms for
academic texts in their subjects. The development of glosses,
*summae*, *questiones*, *distinctiones*, etc., came later, as did
the awareness of teachers like Bernard of Pavia that their compilations
might become standard school-texts (and, hence, that comments were
best relegated to the margins)." @winroth_making_2000, 191.

[^3]: At most, there seems to have been a limited claim of authority
being made by the authors of the first-recension *dicta* (Gratian 1)
on behalf of their *magister*, the author of the case statements
(Gratian 0), whose harmonization of the canons was authoritative
for them.

[^4]: @odonnell_augustine_2005, 136, 139. The need for scribal or
secretarial support presupposes that authors create texts by dictating
them.

[^5]: John Anthony McGuckin, "The Life of Origen (ca. 186–255)" in
*The Westminster Handbook to Origen*, 12. McGuckin got this story
from Eusebius, *Ecclesiastical History* 6.23.2.

[^6]: Monastic modes of text production were gradually replaced by
commercial modes of production, e.g., around the University of
Paris. See Richard H. and Mary A. Rouse, *Manuscripts and their
Makers: Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris 1200-1500.*

[^8]: The quasi-monastic model of text production leaves open a range of
possibilities. Those who have read the *Vita Augustini* written by
Possidius of Calama († c.437) are likely to be unimpressed by the
intellectual caliber of Augustine's episcopal household, and to
assess its contribution to his work accordingly.

[^9]: @grebner_patronate_2007; @winroth_where_2013;
@pennington_biography_2014; and @pennington_biography_2018.

[^10]: @barthes_death_1977; and @foucault_what_1998.

[^18]: @foucault_what_1998, 214. Foucault claims to have derived
the four criteria for determining whether a given "discursive set"
has one or several authors from Jerome's *De Viris illustribus*.
He provides, however, no citations. Walzer and Inabinit indicate
that "similar principles" can be found in @hulley_principles_1944,
105-109. @walzer_who_2011, 188. The section of Hulley's article
on "various points pertinent to questions of authorship" is in fact
almost certainly the ultimate source for Foucault's four criteria,
and provides citations to many works by Jerome (not just *De Viris
illustribus*) relevant to the question of determining the authorship
of a text or texts.
