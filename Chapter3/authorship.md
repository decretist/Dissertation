Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around
the figure of the author.[^1] Three examples from classical and
late antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which this requirement
could be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary ambitions with
the support of highly skilled but unfree labor purchased out of his
personal wealth, most famously his slave and later freedman Tiro.
A wealthy lay patron named Ambrose paid for the secretarial staff
that supported the authorial activities of Origen of Alexandria
(†253).[^2] Quasi-monastic members of the episcopal household of
Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided the scribal support that made
his prodigious authorial output possible. The mode of production
pioneered by Augustine and his household in which monastic labor
enabled the creation of original texts by their authors as well as
the subsequent copying and circulation of finished texts proved a
durable one, and predominated in the Latin West until the thirteenth
century.[^3]

Authorship of a text the size of Gratian's *Decretum* was therefore
necessarily a collaborative effort.

## Authorship

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Grebner, Winroth, and
Pennington[^4] reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes
that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we will have
identified the author of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of
the first recension), with authorship of the text understood in a
way not unlike the way in which we might understand the authorship
of a modern literary text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept
of authorship, allowing for the possibility that there might have
been multiple authors.) In conducting this kind of "quest of the
historical Gratian," historians have uncritically accepted a
conceptualization of authorship that is somewhat anachronistic when
applied to a medieval text and has been largely discarded by literary
scholarship over the last half-century.

Roland Barthes's 1967 essay "The Death of the Author" and Michel
Foucault's 1969 response "What Is an Author?" are foundational
readings in the theory of authorship.[^5]

### Barthes

"The Death of the Author" holds a place in literary studies somewhat
similar to the place that Noonan's "Gratian Slept Here" holds in
canon law studies---it is a clearing of the ground of older ways
of thinking in the field. Although the title of the essay was a
lightning-rod in 1980s theory war polemics, taken as if Barthes
were arguing that texts somehow wrote themselves, Medievalists will
recognize the French title of the essay, "La mort de l'auteur," as
a pun on *Le Morte d'Arthur*. Barthes's essay is short and relatively
free of arcane technical terms. Barthes was a literary critic and
scholar making an argument to other literary critics and scholars
against the practice of close-reading literary texts with the focus
on the biographical and historical context of the author and its
relationship to the text.

Barthes uses the term "Author" to indicate the conceptualization
of authorship he is arguing against and the term "author" where he
intends to use the word in its more general and non-technical sense.
An Author is the creative intellect uniquely responsible for a
literary text, and "is in the same relation of antecedence to his
work as a father to his child." [@barthes_death_1977, 145] Barthes
argues that authors cannot be Authors---no person or persons can
have a parent-child relationship to a text since all literary texts
are socially constructed: "The text is a tissue of quotations drawn
from the innumerable centres of culture." [@barthes_death_1977,
146]

**Gratian may be the author of the *dicta* but he is not their
Author. The *dicta* are socially constructed "tissue[s] of quotations
drawn from the innumerable centres of culture."**

The Barthes's central argument is against precisely the kind of
reading that is prevalent in scholarship on Gratian and the *Decretum*:

> To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to
furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing. Such a
conception suits criticism very well, the latter then allotting
itself the important task of discovering the Author (or its hypostases:
society, history, psyche, liberty) beneath the work: when the Author
has been found, the text is 'explained' - victory to the critic.
[@barthes_death_1977, 147]

Barthes uses the term "scriptor" to indicate an alternative
conceptualization of authorship in which the performative aspect
of the author's act is the central focus. Barthes uses the terms
"criticism" and "critic" to refer respectively to the activity of
close-reading a literary text and one engaging in that activity.
Translating the terms as "reading" and "reader" would not be seriously
misleading. Gratian as author of the *dicta* is therefore, using
Barthes's definitions, both scriptor and critic. The *dicta* were
originally delivered in a classroom setting, and thus have both a
performative and a contemporaneous aspect ("there is no other time
than that of the enunciation and every text is eternally written
*here* and *now*" [@barthes_death_1977, 145]) The *dicta* are also
the record of a particular close-reading of a selection of authoritative
texts.

### Foucault

Foucault's essay is a response to Barthes's.

Foucault's essay is more directly relevant than Barthes's to the
problems of authorship raised by Gratian's *Decretum*,

[^1]: Check Peter Brown, *Augustine of Hippo* and James J. O'Donnell,
*Augustine: A New Biography* to see if either of them makes the
point that scribal or secretarial support was required for individual
authorship in antiquity. The need for scribal or secretarial support
presupposes that authors create texts by dictating them.

[^2]: John Anthony McGuckin, "The Life of Origen (ca. 186–255)" in
*The Westminster Handbook to Origen*, 12. McGuckin got this story
from Eusebius, *Ecclesiastical History* 6.23.2.

[^3]: Monastic modes of text production were gradually replaced by
commercial modes of production, e.g., around the University of
Paris. See Richard H. and Mary A. Rouse, *Manuscripts and their
Makers: Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris 1200-1500.*
