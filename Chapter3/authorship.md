Authorship on any significant scale in the pre-modern world required
wrapping a specialized and expensive scribal infrastructure around
the figure of the author.[^1] Three examples from classical and
late antiquity illustrate the possible ways in which this requirement
could be met. Cicero (†43 BCE) pursued his literary ambitions with
the support of highly skilled but unfree labor purchased out of his
personal wealth, most famously his slave and later freedman Tiro.
A wealthy lay patron named Ambrose paid for the secretarial staff
that supported the authorial activities of Origen of Alexandria
(†253).[^2] Quasi-monastic members of the episcopal household of
Augustine of Hippo (†430) provided the scribal support that made
his prodigious authorial output possible. The mode of production
pioneered by Augustine and his household in which monastic labor
enabled the creation of original texts by their authors as well as
the subsequent copying and circulation of finished texts proved a
durable one, and predominated in the Latin West until the thirteenth
century.[^3]

Authorship of a text the size of Gratian's *Decretum* was therefore
necessarily a collaborative effort.

## Authorship

The recent work on the life of Gratian by Grebner, Winroth, and
Pennington[^4] reviewed in the preceding section tacitly assumes
that if we can identify the historical Gratian, we will have
identified the author of the *Decretum* (or at least the author of
the first recension), with authorship of the text understood in a
way not unlike the way in which we might understand the authorship
of a modern literary text. (Noonan entertains a more nuanced concept
of authorship, allowing for the possibility that there might have
been multiple authors.) In conducting this kind of "quest of the
historical Gratian," historians have uncritically accepted a
conceptualization of authorship that is somewhat anachronistic when
applied to a medieval text and has been largely discarded by literary
scholarship over the last half-century.

[^1]: Check Peter Brown, *Augustine of Hippo* and James J. O'Donnell,
*Augustine: A New Biography* to see if either of them makes the
point that scribal or secretarial support was required for individual
authorship in antiquity. The need for scribal or secretarial support
presupposes that authors create texts by dictating them.

[^2]: John Anthony McGuckin, "The Life of Origen (ca.  186–255)"
in *The Westminster Handbook to Origen*, 12. McGuckin got this story
from Eusebius, *Ecclesiastical History* 6.23.2.

[^3]: Monastic modes of text production were gradually replaced by
commercial modes of production, e.g., around the University of
Paris. See Richard H. and Mary A. Rouse, *Manuscripts and their
Makers: Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris 1200-1500.*
