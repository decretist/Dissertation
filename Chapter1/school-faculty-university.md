A number of your comments concern the rapid transition from school
to faculty to university in the twelfth century. Like the triple-point
temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous states
of matter are all present, the compilation of the first recension
of the *Decretum* sits at a triple-point moment at which aspects
of the school, faculty, and university are all present. The classroom
performance of the historical Gratian that I suggest was preserved
(memorialized?) by his students in the form of the first recension
of the *Decretum* was clearly a phenomenon of the schools. I'm
suggesting that the existence and availability of books like *Sic
et Non* and the *Decretum* made possible the transition away from
the school characterized by the personal, highly individualized,
teaching of a master learned and charismatic enough to gather a
critical mass of students. With the transition from school to
faculty, the basis for instruction was no longer (or at least not
exclusively) on individualized instruction or personal teaching
offered by a particularly gifted master. Instead instruction was
based on a widely-available, soon to be standardized, textbook, or
an abbreviation of one.

The transition from faculty to university, I think, has been obscured
by retrospective myth-making in which famous universities, once
established, project their origins as far into the past as possible
in order to enhance the lustre of their names.
