Both the content and the form of the *Decretum* had an enormous
impact on the civilization of medieval Europe. Gratian's methodological
breakthrough transformed the study of canon law into a rigorous
academic discipline. His imposition of a consistent interpretive
framework (hermeneutic) on the inherited and internally contradictory
mass of canonical texts transformed them into a coherent system of
law. A generation before Gratian, Ivo of Chartres (†1115) had
proposed the possibility of such a program in the preface to his
own canonical collections, but he left its application to his
readers. Gratian demonstrated that Ivo's program could in fact be
carried out in a truly systematic way and did so at an historical
moment when the need for such a sweeping synthesis was particularly
compelling. Gratian was working in the immediate aftermath of the
Concordat of Worms (1122), which recognized the formal juridical
independence of the Church from secular authority. Gratian's
*Decretum* provided a comprehensive blueprint for the legal machinery
by which the Church ultimately came to govern the many aspects of
life in Christian society over which it claimed exclusive jurisdiction.

The form in which Gratian's intellectual achievement was transmitted
had as great an impact as its content. The *Decretum* was arguably
the first book in the European tradition written from the ground
up as a textbook. Gratian's own teaching was probably typical of
the relatively informal and unstructured environment of the medieval
schools, organized around the activity of a gifted master, learned
and charismatic enough to gather a critical mass of students. The
existence of a textbook, however, made it possible for someone other
than the original master to teach the same, or a similar, course.
A textbook that circulates widely enough becomes a *de facto*
standard, and classes taught from it, by whomever, become likewise
standardized. The *Decretum*, and classes taught from it or its
abbreviations, attained the status of *de facto* standards across
much of Europe very quickly---within two decades. I believe that
the new evidence previewed in the introduction above suggests that
while we owe the intellectual substance of at least the first
recension of the *Decretum* to Gratian, we owe the words in which
that substance was expressed to his students.

The compilation and circulation of the *Decretum* led directly to
the formation of faculties of canon law across Europe. Faculties
came into being as an institutional response to a new problem raised
by standardized classes taught from standardized textbooks: what
are the requisite qualifications for the teaching of canon law?  In
some respects, early faculties were similar to other medieval guilds
that regulated competition between masters in places where material
and political conditions favored the concentration of many masters
practicing the same craft in one place.[^a] Faculties and craft
guilds, however, differed in one important respect: while the most
imporant product of the masters of the guild of shoemakers was
shoes, the most important product of the masters of the faculty of
canon law was, at least in the first generation, the next generation
of masters of the faculty of canon law. The distinctive innovation
of the faculty was the conferring of credentials or qualifications
(degrees is perhaps anachronistic) on students who completed a
prescribed sequence of standardized courses, defined in such a way
that the requirements for completion for students coincided with
those for
admission to teaching. The faculty was a crucial intermediate stage
in the institutional evolution from school to university, one that
has been obscured by the retrospective myth-making of famous
universities, which, once established, sought to enhance the lustre
of their names by projecting their origins as far as possible into
the past.[^1] It is perhaps going too far to claim that the *Decretum*
was the textbook that created the university. It is not, however,
going too far to recognize that its existence was a necessary
precondition for the emergence of the faculty of canon law, just
as the existence of Peter Lombard's *Sentences* was a necessary
precondition for the emergence after 1160 of the faculty of
theology.[^2]

In the first decades of the thirteenth century, both the faculties
of canon law and the *Decretum* settled into their permanent places
in the organization of medieval academic life, as the faculties of
canon law joined with other faculties (such as arts and theology)
to form the corporate university, and the focus of legal scholarship
in canon law gradually shifted from the "old law" of Gratian to the
"new law" of papal decretals.[^3]

Recent complaints about the corporatization of the university
notwithstanding, *universitas* means corporation.[@verger_patterns_1992,
37-41] We think of a corporation as a commercial entity, but medieval
legal thinkers looked upon the corporation at a more basic level,
as a means for legally creating an artificial person, and then
investing that "person" with rights and privileges that could
otherwise only be held by a natural person or persons, such as the
right to own property, or in the case of a cathedral chapter, the
right to elect a bishop.[^5] Implicit in the development from schools
(which rarely survived the departure or death of their masters) to
faculties was an aspiration toward institutional permanence, or at
least stability. The right of a faculty to own property was obviously
useful to that end. The most fundamental right for a faculty,
however, was that of determining qualifications for teaching, and
it was one that was often contested by the local bishop. The
incorporation of one or more faculties as a university provided a
form of organization well-adapted for achieving both permanence and
independence from local ecclesiastical authority through the
accumulation of legal rights and privileges. The faculties survived,
but as subordinate units within the university.

The *Decretum* remained the standard textbook for the prerequisite
first course in canon law throughout the Middle Ages. Around 1190,
however, while the evolution from faculty to university was still
in progress, the focus of academic canonists shifted away from
Gratian and toward the new jurisprudence of papal decretals.
Scholarly attention devoted to the *Decretum* after 1190 tended to
focus on improving its utility as a teaching text. Between 1214 and
1217, [Johannes
Teutonicus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a303)
(c.1170-1245) compiled more than a half-century's worth of accumulated
commentary on Gratian into the *Glossa
Ordinaria*,[@weigand_development_2008, 82-86] and [Bartholomeus
Brixiensis](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a050)
(fl.1234-1258) revised the ordinary gloss between 1234 and
1241.[@weigand_development_2008, 88-91] By then, the interest of
thirteenth century teachers and students centered on a new advanced
second course in canon law taught from Raymond de Peñafort's
*Decretales Gregorii IX* (1234), edited from five earlier compilations
of papal decretals that had become a teaching library of decretal
law. The *Decretum* retained its status as a classic textbook but
never again held the intellectual attention of the discipline in
the way it had during the second half of the twelfth century.

[^1]: "By the first decade of the thirteenth century the private
    schools of canon law had become part of the corporate structure
    of the universities in all three places [Bologna, Paris, and
    Oxford]." [@brundage_teaching_2008, 98-99]. **Brundage here
    somewhat overstates the degree of institutional evolution the
    proto-universities had attained at this time. The corporate
    structure of the university had fully emerged by the first
    decade of the thirteenth century only at Bologna. It did not
    do so at Paris and Oxford until the second decade of the century.
    The standard handbooks on the history of the university in
    medieval Europe, [@rashdall_universities_1936] and
    [@ridder-symoens_universities_1992], are less helpful on this
    point than might be hoped.**

    **Bologna:** "Bologna vies with Paris for the title of oldest
    and most distinguished university of medieval Europe, but whereas
    Paris was essentially a guild of masters, Bologna was in origin
    an association of students. The *universitas scholarium* emerged
    around 1190 as an organization of the non-Bolognese law students
    resident in the city, and rapidly developed a complex constitution
    rather like that of contemporary communes." [@hyde_bologna_1982,
    311].

    **Oxford:** "The origins of the university are shrouded in
    obscurity." [@leader_oxford_1982, 320]. "Oxford probably developed
    in the twelfth century out of an informal group of masters
    teaching near St. Mary's Church. Among the first known masters
    was Theobald of Étampes, who was lecturing before 1100 (ca.
    1095) and continued until about 1125. This group of scholars
    seems to have increased markedly following Henry II's prohibition
    of foreign study in 1170, and by 1185 Gerald of Wales (Giraldus
    Cambrensis) recorded that they were organized into several
    faculties (*doctores diversarum facultatum*), which, although
    likely an exaggeration, indicates there was a varied group of
    scholars. This development is implied by several other late
    twelfth-century authorities as well." [@leader_oxford_1982,
    320]. "The university was first recognized as a legal corporation
    by a legatine ordinance of 1214, ending a dispersal of the
    university following a riot with the townsmen in 1209."
    [@leader_oxford_1982, 320].

    **Paris:** "The school of Notre Dame Cathedral on the Cité, and
    the Abbey of St. Victor and the collegiate church of Ste.
    Geneviève on the Left Bank of the Seine had already by the end
    of the twelfth century attracted such famous masters as Hugh
    of St. Victor, Peter Abelard, Stephen of Tournai, and Peter
    Lombard. In 1180 Alexander Neckham was able to write of an
    'honorable society of masters' who were teaching arts, theology,
    canon law, and medicine, disciplines that would later form the
    four faculties of the university. At this time, the right to
    teach (*licentia docendi*) and therefore to become a master was
    given out by the chancellor of the cathedral chapter of Notre
    Dame." [@gabriel_paris_1982, 408]. "The masters organized
    themselves into an association between 1180 and 1210, later
    called *universitas magistrorum et discipulorum*, and both kings
    and popes granted it protective privileges." [@gabriel_paris_1982,
    408]. "In the beginning, Paris church officials opposed the
    formation of this independent society, which claimed legal
    status and its own seal. The papacy, however, sided with the
    university. Rules regulating its operation, called 'statutes',
    were granted in 1215 by Robert Courson, papal legate, and these
    dealt specifically with curriculum and textbooks."
    [@gabriel_paris_1982, 408].

[^5]: "Four steps would seem to have been pre-eminently necessary
to give to mere customary meetings of masters for the initiation
of new members or similar purposes the character of a definite and
legally recognized corporation: (1) the reduction of their unwritten
customs to the form of written statutes or by-laws, (2) the recognition
or (if authoritative recognition was unnecessary) the exercise of
the right to sue and be sued as a corporation, (3) the appointment
of permanent common officers, (4) the use of a common seal."
