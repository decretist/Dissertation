## Background

Around 1140, a revolutionary textbook transformed the study of canon
law into a systematic academic discipline. It did not have an
attribution of authorship. It did not even have a title. As it
entered widespread circulation in the middle decades of the twelfth
century, however, the new textbook gave rise to a considerable body
of commentary, and some early glosses referred to it as the _Concordia
discordantium canonum_ ("Agreement of disagreeing canons"). The
same glosses identified Gratian, an otherwise unknown teacher thought
to have worked in Bologna, as its author.[^1] As a result, the book
came to be commonly known as the _Decretum Gratiani_ ("Gratian's
_Decretum_").

The _Decretum_ was arguably the first book in the European tradition
written from the ground up as a university textbook. (Abelard's
_Sic et Non_ is the other book for which such an argument might be
advanced.)

[^1]: Eight early manuscripts contain the gloss: "_Concordia
    discordantium canonum iuxta determinationem Gratiani episcopi
    quae in duas partes principaliter est divisa_ (The agreement
    of disagreeing canons according to the determination of Bishop
    Gratian, which is principally divided into two parts.)" See
    below concerning whether, where, and when Gratian served as a
    bishop. Bl = Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery 777; Gt = Ghent,
    Bibl. der Rijksuniversiteit 55; Mt = Montecassino, Bibl. Abbaziale
    66; Pf = Paris, Bibl. Nationale lat. 3884 I and II; Po =
    Pommersfelden, Bibl. des Grafen Schönborn 142 (2744); Ro =
    Rouen, Bibl. municipale E 21 (707); Sl = St. Paul im Lavant,
    Stiftsbibl. 25/1 (XXV.2.6); Tr = Trier, Stadtbibl. 906 (1141).
    Gt, Pf, and Tr indicate that the _Decretum_ has two parts; Bl,
    Mt, Po, Ro, and Sl indicate that it has three. The earliest
    version of the _Decretum_ to survive in more than one manuscript
    (R1) has two parts, while the most widely circulated version
    (R2) has three. Part III of the _Decretum_ (_de Consecratione_)
    is outside the scope of this project, the intent of which is
    to compare the earliest (R1) version with the most widely
    circulated (R2) version for the purpose of determining authorship
    of those parts of the text traditionally attributed to Gratian
    himself. Part III is not found in R1, therefore direct comparison
    is not possible. In any event the class of text traditionally
    attributed to Gratian personally (the sayings or _dicta_) are
    absent from Part III. Therefore, it is not subject to comparative
    analysis using the techniques available for examining Parts I
    and II. [@noonan_gratian_1979, 154] Noonan lists Mazarine 1289
    (possibly a typo for Pm = Paris, Bibl. Mazarine 1287?) in place
    of Sl. [@weigand_fruhe_1990]. [@pennington_biography_2014,
    698-700], supplements Noonan's discussion of these eight glosses.

    The author of the preface to the _Summa Parisiensis_ incorrectly
    thought that Gratian himself had given the collection the title
    _Concordia discordantium canonum_: "_Magister Gratianus, in hoc
    opere antonomasice dictus Magister, loco proœmii talem suo
    præmisit libro titulum: Concordia discordantium canonum, in quo
    materiam et intentionem breviter exponit_ (Master Gratian,
    antonomastically called in this work 'the Master', in place of
    an introduction prefaced his book with the following title,
    _Concord of discordant canons_, by which he concisely sets forth
    subject matter and intention.)" [@mclaughlin_summa_1952, 1]
    English translation from [@somerville_prefaces_1998, 201].
