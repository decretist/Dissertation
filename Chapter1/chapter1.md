Around 1140, a revolutionary textbook transformed the study of canon
law into a systematic academic discipline. It did not have an
attribution of authorship. It did not even have a title. However,
as it entered widespread circulation in the middle decades of the
twelfth century, the new textbook gave rise to a considerable body
of commentary, and some early glosses referred to it as the *Concordia
discordantium canonum* ("Concordance of discordant canons"). The
same glosses identified Gratian, an otherwise unknown teacher thought
to have worked in Bologna, as its author.[^1] As a result, the book
came to be commonly known as the *Decretum Gratiani* ("Gratian's
*Decretum*").

The *Decretum* is *not* the kind of document, like the Fournier
Register---the record of an episcopal inquisition into Albigensian
heretics surviving in a single manuscript---that many non-specialists,
with a journalistic eye for the exotic and the extreme, take to be
the central concern of medieval studies.[^2] The *Decretum* was,
instead, both a normal and a normative text in its own time, and
for centuries thereafter. The *Decretum* survives in an unusually
large number of manuscripts---around 150-200 from the twelfth century
and around 600 for the medieval period as a whole.[^3] The *Decretum*
was the fundamental textbook for first-year university instruction
in canon law through the seventeenth century. As the first volume
of the *Corpus iuris canonici*, the *Decretum* remained valid law
in the Roman Catholic Church until 1917 and exercised enormous
influence over the 1917 and 1983 codifications of canon law that
replaced the medieval *Corpus*.

### School, Faculty, University

Both the content and the form of the *Decretum* had an enormous
impact on the civilization of medieval Europe. Gratian's methodological
breakthrough transformed the study of canon law into a rigorous
academic discipline. His imposition of a consistent interpretive
framework (hermeneutic) on the inherited and internally contradictory
mass of canonical texts transformed them into a coherent system of
substantive law. A generation before Gratian, Ivo of Chartres (†1115)
had proposed the possibility of such a program in the preface to
his own canonical collections, but he left its application to his
readers. Gratian demonstrated that Ivo's program could in fact be
carried out in a truly systematic way and did so at an historical
moment when the need for such a sweeping synthesis was particularly
compelling. Gratian was working in the immediate aftermath of the
Concordat of Worms (1122), which recognized the formal juridical
independence of the Church from secular authority. Gratian's
*Decretum* provided a comprehensive blueprint for the legal machinery
by which the Church ultimately came to govern the many aspects of
life in Christian society over which it claimed exclusive jurisdiction.

The form in which Gratian's intellectual achievement was transmitted
had as great an impact as its content. The *Decretum* was arguably
the first book in the European tradition written from the ground
up as a textbook. Gratian's own teaching was probably typical of
the relatively informal and unstructured environment of the medieval
schools, organized around the activity of a gifted master, learned
and charismatic enough to gather a critical mass of students. The
existence of a textbook, however, made it possible for someone other
than the original master to teach the same, or a similar, course.
A textbook that circulates widely enough becomes a *de facto*
standard, and classes taught from it, by whomever, become likewise
standardized. The *Decretum*, and classes taught from it or its
abbreviations, attained the status of *de facto* standards across
much of Europe very quickly---within the two decades between 1140
and 1160. I believe that the new evidence previewed above suggests
that while we owe the intellectual substance of at least the first
recension of the *Decretum* to Gratian, we owe the words in which
that substance was expressed to his students.[^4]

The compilation and circulation of the *Decretum* led directly to
the formation of faculties of canon law across Europe. Faculties
came into being as an institutional response to a new problem raised
by standardized classes taught from standardized textbooks: what
are the requisite qualifications for the teaching of canon law? In
some respects, early faculties were similar to other medieval guilds
that regulated competition between masters in places where material
and political conditions favored the concentration of many masters
practicing the same craft in one place.[^5] Faculties and craft
guilds, however, differed in one important respect: while the most
important product of the masters of the guild of shoemakers was
shoes, the most important product of the masters of the faculty of
canon law was, at least in the first generation, the next generation
of masters of the faculty of canon law. The distinctive innovation
of the faculty was the conferring of credentials or qualifications
(to call them degrees is perhaps anachronistic) on students who
completed a prescribed sequence of standardized courses, defined
in such a way that the requirements for completion for students
coincided with those for admission to teaching. The faculty was a
crucial intermediate stage in the institutional evolution from
school to university, one that has been obscured by the retrospective
myth-making of famous universities, which, once established, sought
to enhance the lustre of their names by projecting their origins
as far as possible into the past.[^6] It is perhaps going too far
to claim that the *Decretum* was the textbook that created the
university. It is not, however, going too far to recognize that its
existence was a necessary precondition for the emergence of the
faculty of canon law.

In creating his new textbook, Gratian blazed a trail for canon law
that theology followed about two decades later. The appearance
around 1160 of Peter Lombard's *Sentences* served as the catalyst
for a similar transformation of theology into a rigorous academic
discipline taught from a standardized textbook in the context of a
formally organized curriculum by a degree-granting faculty, and for
the displacement of more loosely organized regional schools, such
as the one at Laon, by the preeminent theology faculty of Paris.

In the first decades of the thirteenth century, both the faculties
of canon law and the *Decretum* settled into their permanent places
in the organization of medieval academic life, as the faculties of
canon law became part of the university (a corporation encompassing
several faculties such as those of arts, law, and theology), while
the focus of legal scholarship in canon law gradually shifted from
the "old law" of Gratian to the "new law" of papal decretals.[^7]

Recent complaints about the corporatization of the university
notwithstanding, *universitas* means corporation.[@verger_patterns_1992,
37-41] We think of a corporation as a commercial entity, but medieval
legal thinkers looked upon the corporation at a more basic level,
as a means for legally creating an artificial, collective person,
and then investing that "person" with rights and privileges that
could otherwise only be held by a natural person or persons, such
as the right to own property and the standing of a litigant in
courts of law. The most fundamental right of a corporation, however,
was the right of self-governance, including the right of the
corporation to select its own leadership. The classic medieval
example of corporate self-governance was the right of a cathedral
chapter to elect a bishop. For an academic faculty, the exercise
of the right of corporate self-governance took the particular form
of determining the qualifications for teaching, something often
contested by the local bishop.[^9] The incorporation of several
faculties as a university provided a form of organization well-adapted
for achieving both permanence and independence from local ecclesiastical
authority through the accumulation of legal rights and privileges.
The faculties ensured their own long-term survival by incorporating
within the larger university.

The *Decretum* remained the standard textbook for the prerequisite
first course in canon law throughout the Middle Ages. Around 1190,
however, while the evolution from faculty to university was still
in progress, the focus of academic canonists shifted away from
Gratian and toward the new jurisprudence of papal decretals.
Scholarly attention devoted to the *Decretum* after 1190 tended to
focus on improving its utility as a teaching text. Between 1214 and
1217, [Johannes
Teutonicus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a303)
(c.1170-1245) compiled more than a half-century's worth of accumulated
commentary on Gratian into the *Glossa
Ordinaria*,[@weigand_development_2008, 82-86] and [Bartholomeus
Brixiensis](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a050)
(fl.1234-1258) revised the ordinary gloss between 1234 and
1241.[@weigand_development_2008, 88-91] By then, the interest of
thirteenth-century teachers and students centered on a new advanced
second course in canon law taught from Raymond de Peñafort's
*Decretales Gregorii IX* (1234), edited from five earlier compilations
of papal decretals that had become a teaching library of decretal
law. The *Decretum* retained its status as a classic textbook but
never again held the intellectual attention of the discipline in
the way it had during the second half of the twelfth century.

The emergence of faculties of canon law in the second half of the
twelfth century was a feature of a wider intellectual and social
revolution. There had been a revival in Bologna of the formal study
of Roman law during the second and third decades of the twelfth
century. The immediate impetus for the revival was the recovery of
the great *libri legales* from which law had been taught in the
late Roman world, most importantly, the *Digest* of Justinian, because
it provided the pattern for jurisprudence as a systematic intellectual
activity.[^12] The early Romanists therefore did not need to create
textbooks for their students as Gratian had to for his.

The twelfth-century revolution in legal science did not take place
in a vacuum. It took place because of the emergence, especially in
Italy, of an increasingly urban and commercial society with many
moving parts. Such a society needed a correspondingly complex and
sophisticated legal system, and, because it had much in common,
both culturally and materially, with the society of the late Roman
world, it was able to borrow extensively from Roman law.

The emergence of distinct faculties of arts, law, and theology in
the middle decades of the twelfth century led to a rapid
proliferation of major universities throughout Europe,
recognizably continuous in form with those of the present day. The
existence of standardized textbooks such as Gratian's *Decretum*
and later Peter Lombard's *Sentences* was an absolutely essential
precondition for the formation of academic faculties organized along
formal disciplinary lines, offering standardized courses of instruction
for their students. Those faculties in turn supplied the foundation
for the medieval, and, by extension, the modern European university.
Gratian's *Decretum* can be seen from the point of view of this
series of historical developments as the textbook that set the stage
for the emergence of the university.

## Roman Law

There is good evidence that canon law emerged as a distinct, formally
organized, academic discipline about two decades after Roman law
and about two decades before theology. Therefore, any information
that allows us to refine our knowledge of the dates by which those
disciplines, but especially Roman law, emerged has considerable
evidentiary value for the dating of the emergence of canon law as
well. The current consensus among historians is that the teaching
of Roman law got under way as an organized activity in Bologna
between 1100 and 1110 and that the teaching of canon law got under
way, also at Bologna, a little later, perhaps between 1120 and 1130.

It is first necessary to distinguish the body of Roman law formally
codified in the sixth century under the emperor Justinian (†565)
from the forms of Roman law that had survived through continuous
use and adaptation in southern Europe from late antiquity into the
eleventh century. Early medieval Europe had not forgotten Roman
law, and, in particular, the *Lex Romana Visigothorum* or *Breviary
of Alaric* (506), derived from the Theodosian Code (438), was a
major source of Roman law concepts and terminology throughout the
early middle ages. The codification produced by Justinian's
commissioners under the guidance of Tribonian (†545?) received
limited reception in the sixth century in those parts of Italy then
under Byzantine control. However, it disappeared from view around
the beginning of the seventh century. The last known reference to
the *Digest* in the Latin-speaking and -writing West is found in a
letter of pope Gregory I in 603.[^13]

What was new in Italy from the late eleventh century on was the
revival of the study and application of Roman law as codified in
the *Corpus iuris civilis* of Justinian: the *Institutes*, the
*Codex*, the *Digest* or *Pandects*, and the *Novels*. (The *Novels*,
unlike the other volumes of Justinian's *corpus*, were originally
written in Greek, and were known in this period in the form of a
Latin translation, the *Authenticum*.) The first documentary evidence
for this revival is a reference to the *Digest* found in the *Marturi
placitum*, the record of a court case held in 1076 in present-day
Poggibonsi in Tuscany.[^14]

Because of the title *Corpus iuris civilis*, "the body of civil
law," Roman law was also referred to as civil law, and students,
teachers, and practitioners of Roman law were referred to as
civilians. Gratian, following Isidore of Seville (†636), used a
much older definition: "*Ius civile est, quod quisque populus vel
civitas sibi proprium divina humanaque causa constituit* (Civil law
is what each people and each commonwealth establishes as its own
law for divine or human reasons)."[^15] Gratian, again following
Isidore, referred to Roman law as the law of the Quirites (*Ius
Quiritum*).[^16]

The scholarly consensus that the teaching of Roman and canon law
were going concerns in Bologna by around 1110 and 1130 respectively
has had two notable recent dissenters, Charles Radding and Anders
Winroth. Radding has proposed that the epicenter of the revival of
the study of Roman law was not Bologna, but Pavia, and places the
date somewhat earlier, in the late eleventh century. Radding's claim
is that research into Roman law developed from its having been used
as an analytical tool for the explication of the central text of
the Lombard legal tradition, the *Liber Legis Langobardorum* or
*Liber Papiensis*. Radding's argument has not met with widespread
acceptance.[@radding_origins_1988]

Anders Winroth is by far the more consequential dissenter from the
consensus. He draws attention to the underdeveloped way in which
Gratian uses Justinianic Roman law in what Winroth calls the first
recension, the earliest version of the *Decretum* to survive in
more than one manuscript.

There are only three places in the first recension of the *Decretum*
that incorporate material taken directly from Justinianic Roman law
sources: C.2 q.6 c.28 (an excerpt from the *Authenticum*), and C.15
q.3 cc.1-3 and C.15 q.3 c.4 (three excerpts from the *Codex* and
four from the *Digest*).[@winroth_making_2000, 146-148]

Gratian does not deploy the proper Justinianic shades of meaning
to the concepts of ownership and possession when discussing the
issue of *restitutio in integrum* in the first-recension version
of C.3 q.1 d.p.c.2. Instead, he uses concepts and vocabulary that,
Winroth argues, derive from pre-Justinianic Roman law sources such
as the *Lex Romana Visigothorum*.[@winroth_making_2000, 148-151]

Furthermore, there are places in the first recension where Gratian,
in Winroth's opinion, would have reached different conclusions had
he used Justinianic Roman law. He points to Gratian's treatment of
false (or at least unsuccessful) accusers in C.2 q.3, and the
penalties, including infamy, incurred by them. Gratian's analysis
---he distinguishes three categories of false accusers based on
material indirectly derived from the *Lex Romana Visigothorum*---
is incompatible with the well-developed Justinianic jurisprudence
on the subject.[@winroth_making_2000, 153-156]

But there is one question---C.15 q.3---in the first recension of
the *Decretum* in which Gratian makes substantive use of Justinianic
Roman law concepts and vocabulary as a part of his argument in the
*dicta* and does so more or less correctly in Winroth's judgment.
This is significant from Winroth's point of view, because it
demonstrates that Gratian did not have an ideological objection to
the use of Roman law, as Vetulani and Chodorow argued.[^21] Rather,
Winroth argues that where Gratian either failed to use Roman law,
or used it incorrectly, it was because he lacked the knowledge of
that tradition.[@winroth_making_2000, 151-153]

For reasons that I will discuss more fully below, Winroth is convinced
that the first recension of the *Decretum* cannot have been completed
or entered circulation earlier than around 1140. The underdeveloped
way in which Justinianic Roman law is used in the first recension
therefore leads Winroth to argue that the study and teaching of
Roman law in Bologna had not progressed nearly as far by 1140 as
the consensus holds.

Some corollaries to Winroth's argument that Roman law teaching got
off to a late start are fairly far out of the mainstream. A notable
example is his dating of the famous letter of an anonymous monk to
abbot B (probably Bernard III Garin) of Saint-Victor, Marseille
---the content of which Winroth has so memorably summarized as "[m]y
donkey is dead, so I am going to law school"---to the 1180s rather
than the 1120s. But it is extremely difficult to imagine that a
letter that shows no apparent awareness that either civil (Roman)
or canon law were being taught in Bologna can have been written in
the 1180s.[^23]

Kenneth Pennington has pointed to the *Authentica Habita* (1155/1158)
issued by the emperor Frederick I (†1190), which has traditionally
been taken as extending imperial protection to the law school of
Bologna, its faculty, and its students.[^24] Pennington makes the
common-sense point that a privilege like this is unlikely to have
been granted to an institution just getting off the
ground.[@pennington_short_2002, 17] Winroth counter-argues that the
privilege mentions neither Bologna nor those involved in legal
studies specifically.[^26]

I agree with the consensus that the teaching of Roman and canon law
were going concerns in Bologna by around 1110 and 1130 respectively,
but the reader should keep in mind that Winroth, a scholar whose
point of view is not to be lightly dismissed, thinks otherwise.

In recent years, it has become obligatory to mention at this point
in any discussion of the revolution in legal science the case of
one Mengho, a resident of Bologna who was hanged in December 1299
after having been tortured into confessing to the theft of some
bolts of fabric. There was not in 1299, nor is there now, much doubt
as to Mengho's guilt---a search of his residence was carried out
during the course of the investigation into the crime and he was
found to be in possession of the stolen goods, a state of affairs
that he was unable to credibly explain. Neither can it be seriously
doubted that Mengho's case was conducted according to the due process
standards prevailing in that time and place. Full proof necessary
to convict a criminal defendant (*reus*) under Roman law required
either a confession or the testimony of two witnesses, testimony
unlikely to be forthcoming in the case of a crime of stealth, such
as Mengho's, committed at night. In the absence of a voluntary
confession or the testimony of witnesses, torture of the defendant
in order to obtain an involuntary confession was simply the next
routine step of due process. Indeed, Hermann Kantorowicz (†1940)
brought the story of Mengho to the attention of medieval legal
historians, and it remains well known today, precisely because
Kantorowicz considered it a textbook example of inquisitorial (as
opposed to adversarial) procedure under the *ordo iudiciarius*
derived from Roman law.[^27]

The fact that Mengho was tortured and executed was not the point
of the story for Kantorowicz, but it is for us. In the twenty-first
century, the story of Mengho is brought up to make a particular
point. There is a powerful scholarly tradition going back at least
to Charles Homer Haskins of presenting the revolution in legal
science as an intellectual triumph that took place in the
classroom.[@haskins_renaissance_1927] All revolutions, including
the revolution in legal science, have winners and losers, and some
of the losers we do not feel very sorry for.[^29] But what happened
in the classroom ultimately had consequences in the courtroom,
consequences that were enacted on the rights and property, on the
bodies and lives, of women and men in the real world.

[^1]: Eight early manuscripts contain the gloss: "*Concordia
discordantium canonum iuxta determinationem Gratiani episcopi quae
in duas partes principaliter est divisa* (The agreement of disagreeing
canons according to the determination of Bishop Gratian, which is
principally divided into two parts.)" See below concerning whether,
where, and when Gratian served as a bishop. Bl = Baltimore, Walters

(1141). Gt, Pf, and Tr indicate that the *Decretum* has two parts;
Bl, Mt, Po, Ro, and Sl indicate that it has three. The earliest
version of the *Decretum* to survive in more than one manuscript
(the first recension) has two parts, while the most widely circulated
version (the second recension) has three. Part III of the *Decretum*
(*de Consecratione*) is outside the scope of this project, the
intent of which is to compare the earliest (first-recension) version
with the most widely circulated (second-recension) version for the
purpose of determining authorship of those parts of the text
traditionally attributed to Gratian himself. Part III is not found
in the first recension, therefore direct comparison is not possible.
In any event the class of text traditionally attributed to Gratian
personally (the sayings or *dicta*) are absent from Part III.
Therefore, it is not subject to comparative analysis using the
techniques available for examining Parts I and II. @noonan_gratian_1979
[154]. Noonan lists Mazarine 1289 (possibly a typo for Pm = Paris,
Bibl. Mazarine 1287?) in place of Sl. @weigand_kanonisten_1990.
@pennington_biography_2018 [382-385], supplements Noonan's discussion
of these eight glosses.

    The author of the preface to the *Summa Parisiensis* incorrectly
    thought that Gratian himself had given the collection the title
    *Concordia discordantium canonum*: "*Magister Gratianus, in hoc
    opere antonomasice dictus Magister, loco proœmii talem suo
    præmisit libro titulum: Concordia discordantium canonum, in quo
    materiam et intentionem breviter exponit* (Master Gratian,
    antonomastically called in this work 'the Master', in place of
    an introduction prefaced his book with the following title,
    *Concord of discordant canons*, by which he concisely sets forth
    subject matter and intention.)" @mclaughlin_summa_1952 [1].

[^6]: "By the first decade of the thirteenth century the private
schools of canon law had become part of the corporate structure of
the universities in all three places [Bologna, Paris, and Oxford]."
@brundage_teaching_2008 [98-99]. Brundage here somewhat overstates
the degree of institutional evolution the proto-universities had
attained at this time. The corporate structure of the university
had fully emerged by the first decade of the thirteenth century
only at Bologna. It did not do so at Paris and Oxford until the
second decade of the century. The standard handbooks on the history
of the university in medieval Europe, @rashdall_universities_1936
and @ridder-symoens_universities_1992, are less helpful on this
point than might be hoped.

    Bologna: "Bologna vies with Paris for the title of oldest and
    most distinguished university of medieval Europe, but whereas
    Paris was essentially a guild of masters, Bologna was in origin
    an association of students. The *universitas scholarium* emerged
    around 1190 as an organization of the non-Bolognese law students
    resident in the city, and rapidly developed a complex constitution
    rather like that of contemporary communes." @hyde_bologna_1982
    [311].

    Oxford: "The origins of the university are shrouded in obscurity."
    @leader_oxford_1982 [320]. "Oxford probably developed in the
    twelfth century out of an informal group of masters teaching
    near St. Mary's Church. Among the first known masters was
    Theobald of Étampes, who was lecturing before 1100 (ca. 1095)
    and continued until about 1125. This group of scholars seems
    to have increased markedly following Henry II's prohibition of
    foreign study in 1170, and by 1185 Gerald of Wales (Giraldus
    Cambrensis) recorded that they were organized into several
    faculties (*doctores diversarum facultatum*), which, although
    likely an exaggeration, indicates there was a varied group of
    scholars. This development is implied by several other late
    twelfth-century authorities as well." @leader_oxford_1982 [320].
    "The university was first recognized as a legal corporation by
    a legatine ordinance of 1214, ending a dispersal of the university
    following a riot with the townsmen in 1209." @leader_oxford_1982
    [320].

    Paris: "The school of Notre Dame Cathedral on the Cité, and the
    Abbey of St. Victor and the collegiate church of Ste. Geneviève
    on the Left Bank of the Seine had already by the end of the
    twelfth century attracted such famous masters as Hugh of St.
    Victor, Peter Abelard, Stephen of Tournai, and Peter Lombard.
    In 1180 Alexander Neckham was able to write of an 'honorable
    society of masters' who were teaching arts, theology, canon
    law, and medicine, disciplines that would later form the four
    faculties of the university. At this time, the right to teach
    (*licentia docendi*) and therefore to become a master was given
    out by the chancellor of the cathedral chapter of Notre Dame."
    @gabriel_paris_1982 [408]. "The masters organized themselves
    into an association between 1180 and 1210, later called
    *universitas magistrorum et discipulorum*, and both kings and
    popes granted it protective privileges." @gabriel_paris_1982
    [408]. "In the beginning, Paris church officials opposed the
    formation of this independent society, which claimed legal
    status and its own seal. The papacy, however, sided with the
    university. Rules regulating its operation, called 'statutes',
    were granted in 1215 by Robert Courson, papal legate, and these
    dealt specifically with curriculum and textbooks." @gabriel_paris_1982
    [408].

[^7]: This distinction between old and new law comes from the preface
of [Bernardus
Papiensis](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a061)
(†1213) to his Breviary of *Extravagantia* or First Compilation,
c.1191. @somerville_prefaces_1998 [219, 230-231]

[^9]: "Four steps would seem to have been pre-eminently necessary
to give to mere customary meetings of masters for the initiation
of new members or similar purposes the character of a definite and
legally recognized corporation: (1) the reduction of their unwritten
customs to the form of written statutes or by-laws, (2) the recognition
or (if authoritative recognition was unnecessary) the exercise of
the right to sue and be sued as a corporation, (3) the appointment
of permanent common officers, (4) the use of a common seal."
@rashdall_universities_1936 [299].

    Medieval law knew no regular procedure for incorporation. Every
    effort to form a corporation therefore involved an intensive
    and frequently protracted effort to persuade the relevant
    authority, whether pope, emperor, king or commune, to grant the
    privilege. In addition, medieval legal thought tended to conceive
    of rights rather more concretely than modern legal systems do.
    Every right or privilege was thought of as coming at the expense
    of some other right-holder, and therefore attempts by the early
    universities to form corporations were contested by those,
    usually local bishops, at whose expense the exclusive right to
    confer a license to teach was being secured.

    Although the right of a faculty or university to own property
    might be considered necessary to realizing any aspirations
    toward institutional permanence, in practice, academic corporations
    avoided property ownership in the twelfth and thirteenth
    centuries. Indeed, the fact that they tended to rent rather
    than own the lands and buildings they used could become a
    powerful weapon in the event of "town vs. gown" conflict,
    allowing the university to credibly threaten to relocate
    elsewhere, as the masters and students of Oxford did in 1209.

[^12]: The Digest was not recovered all at once, but in three parts:
the *Digestum vetus* (Dig. 1.1-24.2), the *Infortiatum* (Dig.
24.3-38.17), and the *Digestum novum* (Dig. 39.1-50.17).
@bellomo_common_1995 [62-63]; @muller_recovery_1990 [1-29]; and
@hoeflich_establishment_2008 [5]. The standard modern edition of
the *Digest* can be found in @kruger_corpus_1928. There is a recent
English translation of the *Digest* in @watson_digest_1985.  (See
review in @donahue_translating_1987.) There is an excellent facsimile
edition of the *Codex Florentinus* (Firenze, Biblioteca Laurenziana,
*sine numero*), the sixth- or seventh-century manuscript that served
at least indirectly as the basis for the eleventh- and twelfth-century
recovery of the *Digest* in @corbino_pandectarum_1988.

[^13]: The reference is to Dig. 48.4.7.3. "XIII, 49 Iohanni defensori
exempla legum tradit, secundum quas iudicet" in @norberg_registrum_1982
[1058-1064]. Translated as "13.49 Gregory to John, his defender,
going to Spain. An example of a law," August 603, in @martyn_letters_2004
[863-866].

[^14]: @manaresi_placiti_1955 [333-335]. (no. 437) The *Marturi
placitum* does not explicitly identify the passage in the *Digest*
to which the citation refers, but the fact that the legal principle
being invoked is *restitutio in integrum* is by itself sufficient
to narrow it down to *Dig*. 4. Radding and Ciaralli identify the
passage as *Dig*. 4.6.26.4 (with some wording borrowed from *Dig*.
4.1.5). @radding_corpus_2007 [183-184]. Nordillus, the judge, decided
the case "*lege Digestorum libris inserta considerata* (after he
considered the law inserted into the books of the *Digest*)"
[translation suggested by Atria Larson]. The translation turns on
the interpretation of the participial adjective *inserta*. "I think
the straight-up 'inserted' makes sense here. The writer would seem
to be noticing that the Digest is not itself *lex* but includes
commentary on the *lex*, the written law, and refers to and inserts
many elements of *lex* throughout." (Atria Larson, email to Paul
Evans, July 21, 2017.) The alternative is to translate *inserta*
as "introduced," describing a passage from the Digest that an
advocate for one or the other of the litigants brought to the
attention of the court in support of their case as having been
"introduced." For an English translation of the *Marturi placitum*,

    The date of *Authentica Habita* is uncertain. Frederick ordered
    the constitution inserted into the *Codex* as an act of imperial
    propaganda. No medieval manuscripts of the *Codex* give a date
    for the proclamation. Early modern print editions of the *Codex*,
    however, associated it with the Diet of Roncaglia in November
    1158, and modern editions have retained the ascribed date.
    @pennington_beginnings_2018 [20n53] (MS Word version).  The
    uncertainty arises because a contemporary poem, the *Carmen de
    gestis Frederici I. Imperatoris in Lombardia* gives a first-hand
    account of an incident that took place near Bologna in 1155 in
    which Frederick, in response to a petition brought by a deputation
    of doctors and scholars from the city, issued a proclamation
    matching the description of *Authentica Habita*.  Some modern
    scholars attempt to split the difference by accepting the
    November 1158 date for the version of the text that we have,
    but characterizing it as a re-issue of the 1155 proclamation
    described the *Carmen de gestis*. There appears to be no good
    reason to believe that *Authentica Habita* was promulgated
    twice, in 1155 and 1158, as opposed to just once, in 1155. In
    any event, the uncertainty (within a narrow and circumscribed
    range) about the date *Authentica Habita* was promulgated does
    not take anything away from the validity of the point Pennington
    is making.

[^26]: It is true that *Authentica Habita* does not mention Bologna
explicitly, but instead refers to "the place where they are engaged
in the study of letters." But *Authentica Habita* does specifically
mention "students and especially teachers of divine and sacred laws"
so it is not clear to me why both Pennington and Winroth contest
the latter point. "It [Authentica Habita] did not mention Bologna
nor law students." @pennington_beginnings_2018 [18] (MS Word version).
"The law [Authentica Habita] does not mention Bologna at all, nor
does it mention studies of law." @winroth_teaching_2006 [7-8] (MS
Word version). "The Teaching of Law in the Twelfth Century" has
since been superseded by "Law Schools in the Twelfth Century," which
does not mention *Authentica Habita*.

[^29]: R.I. Moore observes that the establishment of the new order
brought about by the legal revolution "required another change, no
less profound: the replacement of warriors by literate clerks as
the agents of government and the confidants of princes."
