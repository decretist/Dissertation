## Background

Around 1140, a revolutionary textbook transformed the study of canon
law into a systematic academic discipline. It did not have an
attribution of authorship. It did not even have a title. As it
entered widespread circulation in the middle decades of the twelfth
century, however, the new textbook gave rise to a considerable body
of commentary, and some early glosses referred to it as the *Concordia
discordantium canonum* ("Agreement of disagreeing canons"). The
same glosses identified Gratian, an otherwise unknown teacher thought
to have worked in Bologna, as its author.[^1] As a result, the book
came to be commonly known as the *Decretum Gratiani* ("Gratian's
*Decretum*").

The *Decretum* was arguably the first book in the European tradition
written from the ground up as a university textbook. (Abelard's
*Sic et Non* is the other book for which such an argument might be
advanced.)

Gratian's exposition of his method -- the *content* of the *Decretum*
-- transformed the study of canon law into a rigorous academic
discipline. The existence of the *Decretum* transformed the social
context for the teaching and study of canon law. It seems likely
that Gratian's own teaching took place in a fairly informal and
unstructured environment: a master surrounded by a circle of students
for whose studies he provided a focus. But the existence of a
standardized textbook paved the way for academic faculties formally
organized along disciplinary lines to offer standardized courses
of instruction and to confer degrees on those who completed them.
Within a few generations, and certainly by the end of the twelfth
century, organized faculties of canon law had largely displaced --
at least at major centers such as Bologna, Paris, and Oxford --
informal gatherings of students around a master, although the older
model probably continued at more peripheral schools.[^2]

The emergence of faculties of canon law in the middle decades of
the twelfth century was a feature of a wider intellectual and social
revolution. There had been a revival in Bologna of the formal study
of Roman law during the second and third decades of the twelfth
century. The immediate impetus for the revival was the recovery of
the great *libri legales* of the late Roman world, most important,
because it provided the pattern for jurisprudence as a systematic
intellectual activity, the *Digest* of Justinian.[^3] The twelfth-century
revolution in legal science did not take place in a vacuum. It took
place because of the emergence, especially in Italy, of an increasingly
urban and commercial society with many moving parts. Such a society
needed a correspondingly complex and sophisticated legal system,
and, because it had much in common with the society of the ancient
Roman world, it was able to borrow extensively from Roman law.

Gratian, in compiling the *Decretum*, solved a problem for the new
academic discipline of canon law that his counterparts teaching
Roman law had sidestepped: the Romanists had not needed to create
textbooks for their students because they had recovered the textbooks
from which the law had been taught in late antiquity.

By doing so, Gratian blazed a trail for canon law that theology
followed about two decades later. The appearance around 1160 of
Peter Lombard's *Sentences* served as the catalyst for a similar
transformation of theology into a rigorous academic discipline
taught from a standardized textbook in the context of a formally
organized curriculum by a degree-granting faculty, and for the
displacement of more loosely organized regional schools, such as
the one at Laon, by the preeminent theology faculty of Paris.

The emergence of distinct faculties of Roman law, canon law, and
theology in the middle decades of the twelfth century gave rise to
a rapidly proliferating number of major universities throughout
Europe, recognizably continuous in form with those of the present
day. The existence of standardized textbooks such as Gratian's
*Decretum* and later Lombard's *Sentences* was an absolutely essential
precondition for the formation of academic faculties organized along
formal disciplinary lines, offering standardized courses of instruction
for their students. Those faculties in turn supplied the foundation
for the medieval, and, by extension, the modern European university.
Gratian's *Decretum* can be seen from the point of view of this
series of historical developments as the textbook that invented the
university.

## Roman Law

There is good evidence that canon law emerged as a distinct, formally
organized, academic discipline about two decades after Roman law,
and about two decades before theology. Therefore, any information
that allows us to refine our knowledge of the dates by which those
disciplines, but especially Roman law, emerged has considerable
evidentiary value for the dating of the emergence of canon law as
well. The current consensus among historians is that the teaching
of Roman law got under way as an organized activity in Bologna
between 1100 and 1110 and that the teaching of canon law got under
way, also at Bologna, a little later, perhaps between 1120 and 1130.

It is first necessary to distinguish the body of Roman law formally
codified in the sixth century under the emperor Justinian (†565)
from the forms of Roman law that had survived through continuous
use and adaptation in southern Europe from late antiquity into the
eleventh century. Early medieval Europe had not been unaware of
Roman law, and in particular, the *Lex Romana Visigothorum* or
*Breviary of Alaric* (506), derived from the Theodosian Code (438),
was a major source of Roman law concepts and terminology throughout
the early middle ages. The codification produced by Justinian's
commissioners under the guidance of Tribonian (†545?) received
limited reception in the sixth century in those parts of Italy then
under Byzantine control. However, it disappeared from view around
the beginning of the seventh century. The last known reference to
the *Digest* in the Latin-speaking and -writing West is found in a
letter of pope Gregory I in 603.[^4]

What was new in Italy from the late eleventh century on was the
revival of the study and application of Roman law as codified in
the *Corpus iuris civilis* of Justinian: the *Institutes*, the
*Codex*, the *Digest* or *Pandects*, and the *Novels*, translated
from Greek into Latin in the form of the *Authenticum*. The first
documentary evidence for this revival is a reference to the *Digest*
found in the *Marturi placitum*, the record of a court case held
in 1076 in present-day Poggibonsi in Tuscany.[^5]

Because of the title *Corpus iuris civilis*, "the body of civil
law", Roman law was also referred to as civil law, and students,
teachers, and practitioners of Roman law were referred to as
civilians. Gratian, following Isidore of Seville (†636), used a
much older definition: "*Ius civile est, quod quisque populus vel
civitas sibi proprium divina humanaque causa constituit* (Civil law
is what each people and each commonwealth establishes as its own
law for divine or human reasons)."[^6] Gratian, again following
Isidore, referred to Roman law as the law of the Quirites (*Ius
Quiritum*).[^7]

There have been two notable recent outliers, Charles Radding and
Anders Winroth, to the scholarly consensus that the teaching of
Roman and canon law were going concerns in Bologna by around 1110
and 1130 respectively. Radding has proposed that the epicenter of
the revival of the study of Roman law was not Bologna, but Pavia,
and places the date somewhat earlier, in the late eleventh century.
Radding's claim is that research into Roman law developed from its
having been used as an analytical tool for the explication of the
central text of the Lombard law tradition, the *Liber Legis
Langobardorum* or *Liber Papiensis*. Radding's argument has not met
with widespread acceptance.[@radding_origins_1988]

Anders Winroth is by far the more consequential outlier to the
consensus that masters of Roman law were offering organized courses
of instruction in Bologna by around 1110. He draws attention to the
underdeveloped way in which Gratian uses Justinianic Roman law in
what Winroth calls the first recension, the earliest version of the
*Decretum* to survive in more than one manuscript.[^9]

There are only three places in the first recension of the *Decretum*
that incorporate textual material taken directly from Justinianic
Roman law sources: C.2, q.6, c.28 (an excerpt from the *Authenticum*),
and C.15, q.3, cc.1-3 and C.15, q.3, c.4 (three excerpts from the
*Codex* and four from the *Digest*).[@winroth_making_2000, 146-148]

Gratian does not deploy the proper Justinianic shades of meaning
to the concepts of ownership and possession when discussing the
issue of *restitutio in integrum* in the first-recension version
of C.3, q.1, d.p.c.2. Instead, Gratian uses concepts and vocabulary
that Winroth argues derive from pre-Justinianic Roman law sources
such as the *Lex Romana Visigothorum*.[@winroth_making_2000, 148-151]

Furthermore, there are places in the first recension where Gratian,
in Winroth's opinion, would have reached different conclusions had
he used Justinianic Roman law. He points to Gratian's treatment of
false (or at least unsuccessful) accusers in C.2, q.3, and the
penalties, including infamy, incurred by them. Gratian's analysis
-- he distinguishes three categories of false accusers based on
material indirectly derived from the *Lex Romana Visigothorum* --
is incompatible with the well-developed Justinianic jurisprudence
on the subject.[@winroth_making_2000, 153-156]

But there is one question -- C.15, q.3 -- in the first recension
of the *Decretum* in which Gratian makes substantive use of Justinianic
Roman law concepts and vocabulary as a part of his argument in the
*dicta* and does so more or less correctly in Winroth's judgment.
This is significant from Winroth's point of view, because it
demonstrates that Gratian did not have an ideological objection to
the use of Roman law, as Vetulani and Chodorow argued.[^13] Rather,
Winroth argues that where Gratian either failed to use Roman law,
or used it incorrectly, it was because he lacked the knowledge to
do so.[@winroth_making_2000, 151-153]

For reasons that I will discuss more fully below, Winroth is convinced
that the first recension of the *Decretum* cannot have been completed
or entered circulation earlier than around 1140. The underdeveloped
way in which Justinianic Roman law is used in the first recension
therefore leads Winroth to argue that the study and teaching of
Roman law in Bologna had not progressed nearly as far by 1140 as
the consensus holds.

Some corollaries to Winroth's argument that Roman law teaching got
off to a late start are fairly far out of the mainstream. A notable
example is his dating of the famous letter of an anonymous monk to
abbot B (probably Bernard III Garin) of Saint-Victor, Marseille
(the content of which Winroth has so memorably summarized as "[m]y
donkey is dead, so I am going to law school") to the 1180s rather
than the 1120s. But it is extremely difficult to imagine that a
letter that shows no apparent awareness that either civil (Roman)
or canon law were being taught in Bologna can have been written in
the 1180s.[^15]

Kenneth Pennington has pointed to the *Authentica Habita* (1155/1158)
issued by the emperor Frederick I (†1190), which has traditionally
been taken as extending imperial protection to the law school of
Bologna, its faculty, and its students.[^16] Pennington makes the
common-sense point that a privilege like this is unlikely to have
been granted to an institution just getting off the ground.[^17]
Winroth counter-argues that the privilege mentions neither Bologna
nor those involved in legal studies specifically.[^18]

The main point to take away from this discussion is that while I
agree with the consensus that the teaching of Roman and canon law
were going concerns in Bologna by around 1110 and 1130 respectively,
the reader should keep in mind that Winroth, a scholar whose point
of view is not to be lightly dismissed, thinks otherwise.

In recent years, it has become obligatory to mention at this point
in any discussion of the revolution in legal science the case of
one Mengho, a resident of Bologna who was hanged in December 1299
after having been tortured into confessing to the theft of some
bolts of fabric. There was not in 1299, nor is there now, much doubt
as to Mengho's guilt -- a search of his place of residence was
carried out during the course of the investigation into the crime,
and he was found to be in possession of the stolen goods, a state
of affairs that he was unable to credibly explain. Neither can it
be seriously doubted that Mengho's case was conducted according to
the due process standards prevailing in that time and place, torture
being very much a normal part of due process. Indeed, Hermann
Kantorowicz (†1940) brought the story of Mengho to the attention
of medieval legal historians, and it remains well known today,
precisely because Kantorowicz considered it a textbook example of
inquisitorial (as opposed to adversarial) procedure under the *ordo
iudiciarius* derived from Roman law.[^19]

The fact that Mengho was tortured and executed was not the point
of the story for Kantorowicz, but it is for us. In the twenty-first
century, the story of Mengho is brought up to make a particular
point. There is a powerful scholarly tradition going back at least
to Charles Homer Haskins (1927) of presenting the revolution in
legal science as an intellectual triumph that took place in the
classroom. All revolutions, including the revolution in legal
science, have winners and losers, and some of the losers we do not
feel very sorry for.[^20] But what happened in the classroom
ultimately had consequences in the courtroom, consequences that
were enacted on the rights and property, on the bodies and lives,
of women and men in the real world.

## The *Decretum*

The *Decretum* represents a towering intellectual achievement of
the renaissance of the twelfth century that ushered in the high
middle ages in Europe. But whose achievement was it? In particular,
is the *Decretum* the achievement of a single author, or was it the
product of a collaborative authorship? Because so little is reliably
known about the historical Gratian, and because almost everything
that previous generations thought was known about Gratian has proved,
on closer examination, to be myth,[@noonan_gratian_1979] it is best
to make our first approach (*accessus*) to the author through his
text.[^22] The approach is made more difficult by the fact that,
like many modern university textbooks, the *Decretum* underwent at
least one major revision, and was probably the product of a process
of continuous revision.

In 1996, Anders Winroth discovered that four surviving twelfth-century
manuscripts -- Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. Soppr.
A. 1.402 (Fd); Barcelona, Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó, Santa Maria
de Ripoll 78 (Bc); Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles
acquisitions latines 1761 (P); and Admont, Stiftsbibliothek 23 and
43 (Aa) -- preserve the text of what Winroth called the first
recension of the *Decretum*.[^23] In 1998, Carlos Larrainzar
identified Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, latin 3884 I,
fo. 1 (Pfr) as a one-page fragment of a first-recension manuscript
of the *Decretum*.[@winroth_making_2000, 32] And in 2011, Atria
Larson discovered that München, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, lat.
22272 (Mw) contains an abbreviation of the first recension of the
*Decretum*.[@larson_abbreviatio_2011]

Winroth's discovery of the first recension suggests one obvious way
in which it might be problematic to refer simplistically to Gratian
as the author of the *Decretum,* as I have done thus far. Winroth
rejects any presumption of monolithic authorship on stratigraphic
grounds. He argues that the first recension is "coherent and
complete", and that its author intentionally released it into
circulation as a "finished product".[^26] (In other words, it did
not just prematurely escape into the wild like parts of Augustine's
*de Trinitate*.) Winroth thinks of the first and second recensions
as distinct textual layers and argues that two different authors
(Gratian 1 and Gratian 2) compiled the two recensions.[^27]

Several decades before Winroth discovered the first recension of
the Decretum and argued that the Gratian of the first recension was
not necessarily the same as the Gratian of the second recension,
John Noonan pointed out another obvious way in which it might be
problematic to conceptualize the *Decretum* as the product of
monolithic authorship. As was noted briefly above and will be
discussed in further detail below, the second recension of the
*Decretum* had three distinct parts. Noonan warned that the Gratian
of Part I was not necessarily the same as the Gratian of Part II
or Part III. (And in point of fact, the Gratian of Part III, the
compiler of *de Consecratione*, is very unlikely to have been the
same as the Gratian of Parts I and II.) Furthermore, nothing logically
excludes the possibility that Winroth and Noonan are both right and
that the Gratian of the first-recension version of Part I is not
necessarily the same as the Gratian of the second-recension version
of Part I, and so on through all the possible permutation and
combinations of recensions (first and second) and parts (I, II, and
III).[^28]

But long before the discovery of the first recension in the late
twentieth century, the first twelfth-century readers of the *Decretum*
were distinctly aware of the limited extent to which it could be
thought of as the work of a single author. Even those early readers,
near-contemporaries like the author of the *Summa Parisiensis*, who
implicitly endorsed the single author theory by subsuming the entire
vulgate text of the *Decretum* under the eponym "Gratian," recognized
that whoever Gratian was, he was not directly responsible either
for the bulk of the text or for certain notable formal features of
the work, like the division of Part I into *distinctiones*.[^29]
Gratian was working within a well-established genre of academic
writing in medieval Latin literature, the canonical collection.[^30]
The *Decretum* followed in the footsteps of any number of systematic
canonical collections that had been in circulation since the beginning
of the eleventh century.[^31]

Twelfth-century readers of a canonical collection did not necessarily
expect all (or even any) of the words they read to have been written
by the author. They expected instead to find the distinctive
contribution of the author in the selection, editing, and arrangement
of words not his own: canons of councils, decrees of popes, and
extracts from patristic authorities and secular law, often accompanied
by traditional inscriptions ascribing the texts (accurately or
inaccurately) to recognized authoritative sources. Gratian met this
expectation. Around four-fifths of the text of the vulgate *Decretum*
comes from the tradition of canonical texts accumulated over the
first millennium of the church's history. An extremely important
part of the authorial activity of Gratian, then, did consist precisely
in the collection and selection of material from the canonical
tradition and in his presentation and organization of the texts
that he had collected and selected.

If the author of a canonical collection had anything to say on his
own authority, he was expected to do so in a prologue. The Prologue
of Ivo of Chartres, for example, was a work of considerable theoretical
sophistication that continued to circulate independently and find
an audience even after Gratian's *Decretum* superseded the collections
to which it had originally been prepended.[^32] In this respect,
Gratian did not conform to the expectations of the genre in which
he was working. For starters, he did not include a preface, something
that did not escape the somewhat disapproving notice of contemporaries
like the author of the *Summa Parisiensis*.

In presenting and organizing the canonical texts that he had selected,
however, Gratian added a significant amount of first-person commentary
(*dicta*), amounting to around one-fifth (or eighty thousand words)
of the vulgate *Decretum*. Gratian's commentary is what binds the
*Decretum* together into a coherent whole, and his *dicta* form the
backbone of the arguments that he makes. The *dicta* (sayings) are
a feature that Gratian borrowed from another genre, the theological
treatise. In addition to the *dicta*, Gratian also wrote the rubrics,
so-called because they were written in red ink in manuscripts of
the *Decretum*. The rubrics are one-line summaries of canons that
they introduce.

As a first-order approximation, then, Gratian could be considered
the author, in the modern sense of the word, of the *dicta* and
rubrics, and the compiler and arranger of the canons and inscriptions.
(In practice, *dicta*, inscriptions, and rubrics cannot be distinguished
quite so cleanly as we would like: dicta sometimes trail off into
inscriptions, and rubrics and inscriptions are sometimes poorly
separated.[^33]) But, as Noonan further pointed out, the Gratian
who compiled, arranged, and edited the canons and inscriptions was
not necessarily the same as the person who wrote the *dicta*, who
in turn was not necessarily the same as the person who created the
rubrics.[^34] All of these considerations suggest that the presumption
that the *Decretum* was the product of a single author ought to be
entertained with extreme caution. As I turn my attention to the
collection and selection, presentation, and organization of the
canonical texts found in the *Decretum*, I will continue to use the
name Gratian as a conventional label for its author or authors,
while withholding judgment as to whether one person or many stand
behind the name

## Collection and Selection

A canon is an authoritative text, or an excerpt from one, that
provides a rule or norm for Christian life, either for an individual
Christian believer in their clerical or lay station, or for the
Church corporately, at whatever level -- local church or religious
foundation, diocese, province, or the universal Church. The Greek
work *kanon* literally means a ruler or straightedge used to mark
a line, and Christian believers individually and the Church corporately
follow a straight path when they follow the rules marked out by the
*kanones*. "*Canon grece, latine regula nuncupatur. Regula dicta
est eo quod recte ducit, nec aliquando aliorsum trahit. Alii dixerunt
regulam dictam, vel quod regat, vel normam recte vivendi prebeat,
vel quod distortum pravumque est corrigat.* ('Canon' is Greek for
what is called a 'rule' in Latin. It is called a rule because it
leads one aright and never takes one astray. But others say that
it is called a rule because it rules, presents a norm for right
living, or sets aright what is twisted and bent.)[^35] The late
first- or early second-century *Didache* is an example of a very
early Christian text that contains such rules or norms. After the
official recognition of Christianity by Constantine in 313, the
Church had a greater need for an agreed-upon set of rules. Such
rules were provided by the canons of provincial and ecumenical
councils, and somewhat later by papal decretals.

Gratian, strictly speaking, defines canons as either *decreta
Pontificum* ("decrees of pontiffs") or *statuta conciliorum*
("statutes of councils").[^36] The bishops of Rome had cultivated
from a relatively early date the practice of issuing decretal
letters, consciously modeled after Roman imperial rescripts, in
which they laid down disciplinary and doctrinal norms in response
to questions put to them, usually by other bishops.[^37] The earliest
surviving example is a letter from Pope Siricius (†399) to Bishop
Himerius of Tarragona, written in 385 in response to a letter that
Himerius had sent to Siricius's predecessor, Pope Damasus (†384).[^38]
The letter, sometimes referred to by the first word of its text as
the *Directa* decretal, remains an important source for norms
concerning clerical celibacy in late antiquity. The most familiar
example for modern readers of an imperial rescript, the genre after
which the papal decretal letter was modeled, is the early first-century
(ca. 112) correspondence between Pliny the Younger and the emperor
Trajan (†117) concerning how Pliny, as Roman provincial governor
of Bithynia and Pontus, ought to proceed against the Christians.

Another extremely important source for the *Decretum* is canons
from the ecumenical councils and from the more historically important
provincial synods: *Conciliorum vero alia sunt universalia, alia
provincialia*. ("Some councils are universal, others provincial.")[^39]
Although the Council of Nicaea (325) is primarily remembered for
its doctrinal settlement, memorialized in the Nicene Creed, of the
Arian controversy over the divine nature of Christ, it also promulgated
twenty canons of a disciplinary nature. Provincial synods tended
to assume an outsized importance in the canonical tradition when
figures such as Augustine of Hippo (†430) or Caesarius of Arles
(†542) either participated in or presided over them: "*Etiam S.
Augustinus Yponensis episcopus in eadem sinodo legitur fuisse,
temporibus Honorii Augusti.* (It is read that St. Augustine, bishop
of Hippo, also attended this synod.)"[^40] By the time the *Decretum*
was compiled, the cumulative output of the ecumenical councils and
provincial synods amounted to a considerable mass of material, and
Gratian devoted most of *Distinctiones* 15 and 16 to enumerating
the canonically authoritative councils and synods.[^41]

In addition to textual material strictly defined as canons ("decrees
of pontiffs" and "statutes of councils"), Gratian drew on other
sources which, if not canons according to the narrower technical
definition, could be treated as authoritative in a more general
sense. The most important of these *auctoritates* were drawn from
the writings of major patristic figures such as Ambrose (†397),
Jerome (†419 or 420), Augustine (†430), and Gregory (†604), whom
later generations considered doctors of the church.[^42] It is easy
to see how works such as Ambrose of Milan's *De officiis* ("On
duties") -- a Christian answer to the work of Cicero with the same
title -- could be a rich source of norms. Gratian provides an
explicit list of "the works of the holy fathers that are received
in the Catholic Church".[^43] (It is necessary to distinguish the
papal from the patristic when dealing with figures like Gregory.
While textual excerpts from the letters found in the registers of
Gregory clearly derive their authority from the fact that Gregory
was pope, a text like the *Moralia in Job* has an authority to a
large extent independent of the formal ecclesiastical office Gregory
held.)[^44]

Finally, in addition to excerpts from works of patristic authors,
another source for extra-canonical authorities was secular law,
primarily (pre-Justinianic) Roman law but also including the
capitulary legislation of the more important Carolingian emperors
-- Charlemagne (†814), Louis the Pious (†840), and Charles the Bald
(†877) -- and their successors.[^45]

Up to this point, I have been implicitly referring to Gratian's
material sources, texts such as the *Letters* of Gregory I or the
*de Officiis* of St Ambrose from which the canons in the *Decretum*
were ultimately derived. And in a small number of cases, Gratian
did work directly with material sources. Isidore of Seville's
*Etymologies* is an example of a text from which Gratian probably
collected excerpts directly from the material source. It is also
possible that he collected excerpts directly from Gregory the Great's
*Moralia in Job*. But Gratian drew the overwhelming majority of the
canons he compiled in the *Decretum* from formal sources, predecessor
collections containing patristic, conciliar, and papal (as well as
pseudo-papal) authorities, predigested into canon-sized units of
text.

Peter Landau suggested in 1984 that Gratian had relied primarily
on just five formal sources in writing the Decretum: Anselm of
Lucca's *Collectio canonum*, the pseudo-Ivonian *Collectio Tripartita*,
Ivo of Chartes's *Panormia*, Gregory of San Grisogono's *Polycarpus*,
and an anonymous *Collection in Three Books* (*3L*).[@winroth_making_2000,
15-17] (Note that this hypothesis is not universally accepted.
Pennington, for example, believes that Gratian may have relied on
one or more now-lost Central Italian collections similar to 9L.)[^47]

By the end of the Patristic period, the canons of the ecumenical
and of the more historically important provincial councils constituted
a substantial body of canon law, which were gathered into collections
such as the *Collectio Dionysiana* (ca. 500). A later revision of
the *Dionysiana*, the *Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana* (774), exercised
enormous influence on the transmission of canon law to the Carolingian
world and through it to medieval Western Europe.

Collectors like Dionysius Exiguus (†ca. 540), the original compiler
of the *Collectio Dionysiana*, located all authority in the distant
past. This attitude prevailed throughout the period during which
the canonical sources later used by Gratian were being compiled.
Law, however, ultimately has to correspond with and respond to the
needs of contemporary society, and by the ninth century the Church,
especially north of the Alps, was operating in a very different
political and social environment from that of the Mediterranean
world of late antiquity, which had produced the sources for Dionysius's
collection. When faced with the need for new law to cope with new
circumstances, some enterprising Carolingian churchmen took more
recent material -- mostly canons from provincial synods -- and
repackaged them, attributing them to popes from the first century
through Gregory I (†604). Although the compilers of these collections
are usually referred to as "forgers," they were not simply inventing
their sources. Most of the material in the collections was genuine
but of relatively recent origin -- the goal of the forgers was
simply to retroject it far enough into the past to make it
authoritative.

In order to understand the intent of the forgers, one has to
understand the immediate political situation to which they were
reacting. Charlemagne's son and successor, Emperor Louis the Pious
(†840), was dethroned by three of his sons in a ceremony of public
penance in 833. When Louis was unexpectedly restored less than six
months later, he moved quickly to depose many of the bishops who
had participated in imposing the penance on him, starting with Ebbo,
archbishop of Rheims.[^48] The forgers wanted to protect bishops
from being deprived of office by emperor, king, or metropolitan.
They did this by building up the pope as the only superior who could
judge a bishop. This was convenient, because while popes in the
ninth century had considerable moral authority north of the Alps,
they had little real power. The intent of the forgers' program
therefore was to render bishops effectively impervious to judgment.
The collections that resulted from this effort, the so-called
Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals* and *Benedictus Levita*, were accepted
everywhere as genuine in an age lacking any serious historical-critical
awareness, and survived to become important sources for canonical
collectors in the eleventh century.[^49] Many of these forged canons
eventually found their way into Gratian's *Decretum*.

The reform papacy that reached its apogee with the pontificate of
Hildebrand, who reigned as Gregory VII from 1073 to 1085, provided
a new impetus for the collection and study of canons. The special
concerns of the Gregorian reformers also shaped their approach to
the collection and presentation of canons. The consuming interest
of the reform generation was with the relationship between *regnum*
and *sacerdotium* (church and state). Like the eighth- and ninth-century
Carolingian reformers, the eleventh-century reformers were intensely
concerned with the reform and renewal of monastic and clerical life.
The Carolingians had thought that cooperation between ecclesiastical
and secular authorities was essential for the reform of religious
life. The eleventh-century reformers believed that secular rulers
had to acknowledge the jurisdictional supremacy of the papacy and
the independence of the church from lay interference as a necessary
precondition for effective clerical and monastic reform. It is
significant that the most important canon law collections of the
reform period were compiled by prelates sympathetic with the reform
movement, such as Anselm, bishop of Lucca (†1086), compiler of the
*Collectio canonum*; Gregory, cardinal of San Grisogono (†1113),
compiler of the *Polycarpus*; and Ivo, bishop of Chartres (†1115),
compiler of the *Panormia*. These collections were compiled by and
reflected the concerns of reform-minded church administrators.
Burchard of Worms (†1025) was a forerunner of this group -- although
he died before the reform papacy or the investiture controversy,
his *Decretum* has more in common with the collections that came
after it than with those that came before it. His collection is
systematic -- the presentation of the material is organized by topic
-- rather than chronological and reflects concerns similar to those
of his successors.

Unsurprisingly, given their concern with asserting the jurisdictional
supremacy of the papacy and the independence of the church from lay
interference, the eleventh-century collectors showed considerable
interest in the forged decretals of the ninth century. In particular,
146 out of the 252 chapters of the anonymous *Collection in 74
Titles* (ca. 1050) are drawn from the Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals*.[^50]

The program of the Gregorian reformers collided with two practical
realities of eleventh-century life. Abbotts and bishops were large
landowners and therefore important vassals of secular rulers.
Furthermore, secular rulers were almost completely dependent on the
Church for administrative personnel until the rise of university
faculties of Roman law in the twelfth century. It was therefore
essential from the point of view of secular rulers that they should
be able to control appointments to key benefices in order to ensure
the loyalty of their holders. The controversy over this issue
dominated papal-imperial relations for half a century. It was finally
resolved by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which provided that key
benefices were to be filled through regular canonical processes
free from lay interference (such as election by a cathedral chapter)
but that the benefice holder should swear fealty to the secular
ruler for their landholdings.

Conclusion: Gratian depended on a relatively small number of eleventh-
and early twelfth-century systematic canonical collections, his
formal sources, and that those predecessor collections, in turn,
depended on an older stratum of mostly chronologically arranged
canonical collections. To a certain extent, it was formal sources
(almost) all the way down. Gratian was selecting from a body of
canonical material that had already passed through a fairly rigorous
filtering process, and two of the most important filters -- the
ninth-century pseudo-Isidorian forgers and the eleventh-century
Gregorian reformers -- had had an extremely strong ideological
orientation.

[^1]: Eight early manuscripts contain the gloss: "*Concordia
    discordantium canonum iuxta determinationem Gratiani episcopi
    quae in duas partes principaliter est divisa* (The agreement
    of disagreeing canons according to the determination of Bishop
    Gratian, which is principally divided into two parts.)" See
    below concerning whether, where, and when Gratian served as a
    bishop. Bl = Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery 777; Gt = Ghent,
    Bibl. der Rijksuniversiteit 55; Mt = Montecassino, Bibl. Abbaziale

    Stiftsbibl. 25/1 (XXV.2.6); Tr = Trier, Stadtbibl. 906 (1141).
    Gt, Pf, and Tr indicate that the *Decretum* has two parts; Bl,
    Mt, Po, Ro, and Sl indicate that it has three. The earliest
    version of the *Decretum* to survive in more than one manuscript
    (R1) has two parts, while the most widely circulated version
    (R2) has three. Part III of the *Decretum* (*de Consecratione*)
    is outside the scope of this project, the intent of which is
    to compare the earliest (R1) version with the most widely
    circulated (R2) version for the purpose of determining authorship
    of those parts of the text traditionally attributed to Gratian
    himself. Part III is not found in R1, therefore direct comparison
    is not possible. In any event the class of text traditionally
    attributed to Gratian personally (the sayings or *dicta*) are
    absent from Part III. Therefore, it is not subject to comparative
    analysis using the techniques available for examining Parts I
    and II. [@noonan_gratian_1979, 154] Noonan lists Mazarine 1289
    (possibly a typo for Pm = Paris, Bibl. Mazarine 1287?) in place
    of Sl. [@weigand_kanonisten_1990]. [@pennington_biography_2014,
    698-700], supplements Noonan's discussion of these eight glosses.

    The author of the preface to the *Summa Parisiensis* incorrectly
    thought that Gratian himself had given the collection the title
    *Concordia discordantium canonum*: "*Magister Gratianus, in hoc
    opere antonomasice dictus Magister, loco proœmii talem suo
    præmisit libro titulum: Concordia discordantium canonum, in quo
    materiam et intentionem breviter exponit* (Master Gratian,
    antonomastically called in this work 'the Master', in place of
    an introduction prefaced his book with the following title,
    *Concord of discordant canons*, by which he concisely sets forth
    subject matter and intention.)" [@mclaughlin_summa_1952, 1]

    legal principle being invoked is *restitutio in integrum* is
    by itself sufficient to narrow it down to *Dig*. 4. Radding and

    wording borrowed from *Dig*. 4.1.5). [@radding_corpus_2007,

    libris inserta considerata* (after he considered the law inserted
    into the books of the *Digest*)" [translation suggested by Atria
    Larson]. The translation turns on the interpretation of the
    participial adjective *inserta*. "I think the straight-up
    'inserted' makes sense here. The writer would seem to be noticing
    that the Digest is not itself *lex* but includes commentary on
    the *lex*, the written law, and refers to and inserts many
    elements of *lex* throughout." (Atria Larson, email to Paul
    Evans, July 21, 2017.) The alternative is to translate *inserta*
    as "introduced", describing a passage from the Digest that an
    advocate for one or the other of the litigants brought to the
    attention of the court in support of their case as having been
    "introduced." For an English translation of the *Marturi

    The date of *Authentica Habita* is uncertain. Frederick ordered
    the constitution inserted into the *Codex* as an act of imperial
    propaganda. No medieval manuscripts of the *Codex* give a date
    for the proclamation. Early modern print editions of the *Codex*,
    however, associated it with the Diet of Roncaglia in November
    1158, and modern editions have retained the ascribed date.
    [Kenneth Pennington, "The Beginnings of Law Schools in the
    Twelfth Century", p.20, fn.53] The uncertainty arises because
    a contemporary poem, the *Carmen de gestis Frederici I. Imperatoris
    in Lombardia* gives a first-hand account of an incident that
    took place near Bologna in 1155 in which Frederick, in response
    to a petition brought by a deputation of doctors and scholars
    from the city, issued a proclamation matching the description
    of *Authentica Habita*. Some modern scholars attempt to split
    the difference by accepting the November 1158 date for the
    version of the text that we have, but characterizing it as a
    re-issue of the 1155 proclamation described the *Carmen de
    gestis*. There appears to be no good reason to believe that
    *Authentica Habita* was promulgated twice, in 1155 and 1158,
    as opposed to just once, in 1155. In any event, the uncertainty
    (within a narrow and circumscribed range) about the date
    *Authentica Habita* was promulgated does not take anything away
    from the validity of the point Pennington is making.

[^18]: It is true that *Authentica Habita* does not mention Bologna
    explicitly, but instead refers to "the place where they are
    engaged in the study of letters". But *Authentica Habita* does
    specifically mention "students and especially teachers of divine
    and sacred laws" so it is not clear to me why both Pennington
    and Winroth contest the latter point. "It [*Authentica Habita*]
    did not mention Bologna nor law students." Ken Pennington, "The
    Beginnings of Law Schools in the Twelfth Century", 18.

[^22]: "Given this lack of reliable extrinsic evidence, our best
    source of evidence about Gratian is his book(s)". [@wei_gratian_2016,

[^23]: Manuscripts of Gratian's *Decretum* are frequently referred
    to in recent scholarly literature by two-letter abbreviations
    or *sigla* derived from their shelfmarks. A reference to Sg (to
    use a particularly controversial example) is much more compact
    and memorable than one to Sankt Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek 673.
    Rudolf Weigand (†1998) generated the original list of *sigla*
    in the course of his groundbreaking study of early glossed
    manuscripts of the *Decretum*, [-@weigand_glossen_1991]. In the
    context of Weigand's study early means before 1216, when Johannes
    Teutonicus (†1245) finalized the ordinary gloss, or standardized
    commentary, on the *Decretum*. Manuscripts falling outside the
    original scope of Weigand's investigation are now assigned
    *sigla* following the pattern he set. For example, Paris,
    Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles acquisitions latines
    1761, although an extremely important and early (possible the
    earliest) manuscript of the *Decretum*, was not glossed, and
    was therefore not assigned a *siglum* by Weigand. **Winroth
    supplied the *siglum* P by which the manuscript is now commonly
    identified. (verify)** (Although the *sigla* in Weigand's
    *Handschriftenliste* adhere consistently to the two-letter
    convention, some of the *sigla* supplied by other scholars
    deviate from it, e.g., P, Pfr.)

[^26]: "The first recension of the *Decretum* was not a living text.
    It was a finished product which its author considered ready to
    be circulated. This is evident from its text, which is as much
    a finished and polished product as could be expected of any
    twelfth-century text. Further, it is also evident from the fact
    that the first recension survives in one version only; what
    differences there are among the manuscripts are all minor (the
    apparent exception of Aa will be discussed below). They are
    differences one would expect to find in any manuscript tradition,
    arising from scribal mistake or ingenuity. In other words, the
    manuscripts do not represent different stages in the development
    of the text, in the manner of 'classically' living texts, such
    as the *Song of Roland*, where each different manuscript version
    has an equally valid claim to authenticity." [@winroth_making_2000,
    130].

[^27]: "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore
    chosen to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and
    the author of the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are
    not intended to suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not
    have been the same person." [@winroth_making_2000, 122] "It is
    impossible to draw any certain conclusions, but the evidence
    presented in the last two chapters supports the view that that
    two recensions had difference authors." [@winroth_making_2000,
    194-195].

    the standard label of 'canonical collection' to the *Decretum*
    is meant to make clear that I do not classify the rest of the
    *Decretum Gratiani* as a canonical collection in the exact way
    that the work of Regino, Burchard, Anselm of Lucca, or even Ivo
    of Chartres (and many anonymous compilers) was, and yet it was
    a canonical collection in many respects, especially considering
    much of its source material and how it was used. Many abbreviations
    of the *Decretum*, for instance, are clear testimony that some
    religious houses and episcopal courts wanted the canons, not
    the *dicta*; they wanted a pure canonical collection that could
    serve as a reference manual to the church's law."

[^34]: "There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to
    be determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three
    distinctive parts, with several distinctive sections within the
    parts, and these parts have undergone editing as to chapter
    heading, chapter insertions, and chapter order. Whatever the
    later formal ascription, is Gratian responsible for all these
    parts? The other difficulty is the range of roles the one
    'responsible' person might have had -- compiler, commentator,
    rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one or all? The difficulties
    relate to one another, because evidence that Gratian was, say,
    the commentator of Part II does not establish what role he had
    in Part I." [@noonan_gratian_1979, 162-163].
