### Sg translation:

A cleric stirred up (_agitavit_) a question concerning estates against
[another] cleric whom he wished to bring before a civil judge. The
defendant did not wish to stand [trial] except before an ecclesiastical
judge; but the plaintiff (_actor_) drove him out from his possession
through the power of a civil judge. He, disregarding the sentence
of his bishop, administered his office, [and] the bishop, when he
found out about this, gave final judgement against him without hope
of reinstatement. It is asked therefore first, whether a cleric
ought to be brought before a civil judge? Second, if he ought not
to be brought forth, whether this fault is worthy of suspension.
Third, if it was not worthy, whether it is necessary that the one
in contempt be deposed irreparably by (lit. of) the sentence of his
bishop?

actor: this is the only occurrence in any form of the word actor
in the Sg version of the text of the case statements. (The word
actor also occurs exactly once in the Fr. version of the text of
the case statements, in the same place.) The initiator or initiators
of a legal action are far more frequently described in the case
statements using forms of the word accusator (10 occurrences in Sg,
and 18 occurrences in Fr.)

Ille contempta episcopi sui sententia offitium suum administravit,
hoc conperto episcopus sine spe restitucionis in eum sententiam
dedit: lit. He, the sentence of his bishop having been disregarded,
administered his office, this thing having been found out, the
bishop gave sentence against him without hope of restitution. The
Sg version of C.11 d.init. omits a crucial intermediate step from
the sequence of events in the narrative. In the Fr. version of the
narrative, when the plaintiff's bishop learns of his having litigated
his claim against a clerical defendant before a civil judge, he
suspends the plaintiff from the exercise of his ecclesiastical
duties. This is the sentence the plaintiff disregards.

### Fr. text:

> (Fr. 626) Clericus aduersus clericum questionem de prediis agitauit,
> quem ad ciuilem iudicem producere uoluit reus non nisi ante iudicem
> ecclesiasticum stare uolebat; actor uero potentia ciuilis iudicis
> illum a possessione sua deiecit. Quo audito episcopus eum ab offitio
> suspendit; ille contempta episcopi sui sententia offitium suum
> administrauit. Hoc conperto episcopus sine spe restitutionis in eum
> sententiam dedit. (Qu. I.) Hic primum queritur, utrum clericus ante
> ciuilem iudicem sit producendus? (Qu. II.) Secundo, si producendus
> non est, an hec culpa sit digna suspensione? (Qu. III.) Tertio, si
> digna non fuerit, an contemptorem sententiae sui episcopi inreparabiliter
> oporteat deponi?
