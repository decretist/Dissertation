### Sg translation:

> Certain fornicators also noted with infamy strive to accuse a certain
> bishop concerning simony. The defendant seeks out the court of the
> archbishop of another province, [but] in the end the accusers fall
> short in proof, [and] the defendant is summoned to the assertion
> of his innocence. It is asked therefore whether (_utrum_) [those]
> caught in a net by crime or (_seu_) noted with infamy, ought to be
> admitted to an accusation of this kind? Second, whether the bishop
> if he wished to turn back the accusation against them, whether it
> ought to be yielded from his plain assertion. Third, if it is allowed
> to him (_sibi_) to seek out the court of the archbishop of another
> province? Fourth, whose court ought to be sought out for him (_sibi_),
> if co-provincial bishops _extiterint_ discords about his sentence?
> Fifth, if the accuser falls short in proof, whether the defendant
> ought to be summoned to proof of his innocence?

### Fr. text (95 words):

> (Fr. 553) Duo fornicatores et infamia notati quendam religiosum[^6a]
> episcopum de symonia accusare nituntur; reus alterius prouinciae
> archiepiscopi iudicium expetit; tandem in probatione deficit
> accusator;[^6b] reus cogitur ad innocentiae suae assertionem.
> (Qu. I.) Primo queritur, an crimine irretiti uel infamia notati ad
> huiusmodi accusationem sint admittendi? (Qu. II.) Secundo, si
> episcopus in eos accusationem uertere uoluerit, an simplici assertioni
> suae sit fides habenda? (Qu. III.) Tertio, si liceat sibi expetere
> iudicium archiepiscopi alterius prouinciae? (Qu. IV.) Quarto, cuius
> iudicium sibi sit expetendum, si circa suam sententiam episcopos
> suae prouinciae discordare contigerit? (Qu. V.) Quinto, si in
> probatione deficit accusator, an reus sit cogendus ad probationem
> innocentiae suae?

[^6a]: Does the adjective _religiosum_ indicate that the accused
bishop is a member of the regular as opposed to the secular clergy?
What difference if any does this make with respect to the legal
issues raised by the case statement?

[^6b]: It is not clear why _accusator_ is singular in Fr., especially
since the logic of the case statement leads the reader to expect a
plural reading. Verified as singular in Fr. (553), Ka (124vb), and
Kb (117va).
