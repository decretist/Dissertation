[Introduction to comparative translations of the Sg and Friedberg
(vulgate) texts of the case statements or _themata_.]

The rationale for using Friedberg as the baseline for comparison
is that Winroth's edition in progress of the first recension is not
yet complete enough for the purpose. As of the most recent, 22 April
2019, version, eight case statements (for cases 1-3, 9, 15, 24, 30,
and 34) appear to have a complete critical apparatus. An addition
six case statements (for cases 4-7, 10, and 11) have an incomplete
critical apparatus that records variant readings from Fd only. The
critical apparatus for the case statement for case 35 records a
single variant reading from Aa. The remaining 21 case statements
(for cases 8, 12-14, 16-23, 25-29, 31-33, and 36) have no critical
apparatus at all.

Fortunately, the text of the case statements is fairly stable over
the course of development of the _Decretum_ between its first
recension and vulgate versions. Winroth in the appendix to _The
Making of Gratian's Decretum_ [@winroth_making_2000, 216] reports
only one significant variant reading for a case statement. The
first-recension version of C.19 d.init. omits the phrase "unus
relicta propria ecclesia eo inuito, alter dimissa regulari canonica
cenobio se contulit." That the vulgate supplies the missing phrase
is meaningful because it makes sense of the fact that there are two
clerics in the story, an otherwise inexplicable feature of the
first-recension and Sg versions of the case statement. Textual
differences between the first-recension and vulgate versions of the
other case statements are relatively minor. (e.g., "episcopus
minime concurrit" AaBcFdP versus "episcopus minime occurrit" Fr.
in C.4 d.init.)

This approach---applying the variants recorded in Winroth's appendix
to Friedberg's vulgate text to generate a stand-in or proxy for the
first recension---is consistent with the approach I have taken
throughout my dissertation project. Winroth himself took a similar
approach when he created the baseline text for the edition in
progress of the first recension (although he imposed a set of
orthographic conventions different from Friedberg's on the resulting
text). Regardless of how Winroth conceptualized what he was doing,
it is an approach that is well-theorized in a Digital Humanities
context as an example of "deformance." The term, proposed by Lisa
Samuels and Jerome McGann in "Deformance and Interpretation" (1999),
conflates the words "deformation" and "performance", and describes
a process through which a text is transformed by the application
of a series of deformances to generate a "paratext".
[@samuels_deformance_1999] The paratext is different from the
original text, but defined by the deformances through which it was
generated from it, and can be analyzed for otherwise unavailable
insights into the original text.

## Sg

The primary focus of my dissertation has been on the textual
relationship between the case statements in Part II of Gratian's
_Decretum_ and the first-recension _dicta_. As I have discussed at
some length in Chapter 4 above, the author of the case statements
appears unlikely to have been the same person as the author of the
first-recension _dicta_, the person we usually think of as Gratian.
The text of the case statements is relatively stable over the course
of the development of the _Decretum_ from the first recension to
the vulgate. There is, however, another version of the text of the
case statements that needs to be considered, the one found in the
Sankt Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript of the _Decretum_.

The version of the _Decretum_ preserved in Sg contains around a
thousand canons, and it is therefore considerably shorter than
either the first recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945)
versions of the text.[^3]

[^3]: See @larrainzar_borrador_1999 for number of canons in Sg,
emphasizing that it is approximate. Pennington has
[1,050](http://legalhistorysources.com/Canon%20Law/ComparisonGratian.htm).
See @winroth_making_2000 for number of canons in first recension.
3,945 is a conventional number.]

Formally, Sg is not divided into parts; all of its content is
presented in the form of cases. The first case, however, unique to
Sg and referred to as Causa Prima to distinguish it from Causa I
found in the first recension and vulgate versions, contains a subset
of the canons found in Part I in other versions of the _Decretum_.
Sg has 33 cases, adding Causa Prima and omitting cases 24, 25, 26,
and 28.

The Sg version of the text of the case statements has 3,226 words,
shorter than but comparable to the first-recension and vulgate
versions (3,605 words confirm). The text of the 32 directly
corresponding case statements, removing C.Prima for Sg, and removing
C.24, 25, 26, and 28 for the vulgate, is slightly more compact in
Sg (3,173 words) than in the vulgate (3,312 words). **The Sg cases
statements are not more "verbose" than their vulgate counterparts.**
There are, however noticeable differences in vocabulary.

### Sg translation:

Someone was excommunicated and arranges to accuse a bishop; he
brings in an adolescent under 14 years for the purpose of asserting
the case with him. Who, when he is prohibited from accusation, makes
himself a witness and the minor the accuser;[^4] but the minor
wishes to perform the role of [both] accuser and witness. On the
appointed day, the bishop does not come to court [and] is suspended
from communion. After the court reconvened again,[^5] the accuser
is found [to be] at fault in [bringing] the accusation. Finally,
he proceeds to the assertion of his own case. It is asked therefore
first whether an excommunicate can accuse another? Second, whether
someone (_quis_) under 14 years is able to testify in a criminal
case? Third, whether someone (_quis_) prohibited from accusation
can assume the part of testifying? Fourth, whether the same person
can be [both] accuser and witness? Fifth, whether someone (_quis_)
not coming on the predetermined (_praestituta_) day ought to be
excommunicated, that is, deprived of communion? Sixth, if someone
(_quis_) found [to be] at fault in the episcopal court ought to be
further (_amplius_) admitted to the assertion of his own case?

[^4]: Reading here as _accusatorem_; presumably as a result of
scribal error, Sg reads _accusatore_.

[^5]: _lit_. "the court having been renewed again".

One of the apparent contrasts between the Sg and vulgate (Fr.)
versions of C.4 d.init. is in their use of legal technical terms.
The refusal of the accused bishop to appear before the court on the
appointed day, presumably because he does not recognize its authority
to try a case arising from an improper accusation, is described in
the Sg version using everyday language: "_episcopus ad iudicium non
venit_ (the bishop does not come to court)." Similarly in the fifth
question arising out of his refusal: "_an quis non veniens die
praestituta excommunicari debeat_ (whether someone not coming on
the predetermined day ought to be excommunicated)." The vulgate
(Fr.) version of C.4 d.init., however, uses _minime occurrit_ in
place of _non venit_ and _occurrens_ in the place of _veniens_ in
a way that presumes that _minime occurrit_ is a legal technical
term with almost precisely the same meaning we use today when we
say that a criminal defendant has been cited for failure to appear
in court.[^6][^7]

[^6]: There is also a literary precedent for translating the somewhat
opaque phrase _minime occurit_ as "does not appear" in the commentary
of Maurus Servius Honoratus on Virgil: "_aut audire quod non dicitur,
videre quod minime occurrit_ (or to hear what is not spoken, to see
what does not appear)". **Add reference to critical edition of
Servius.**

[^7]: AaBcFdP reads _minime concurrit_ rather than _minime occurrit_.
It is not clear whether this variant is meaningful, or whether it
simply perpetuates an error introduced into the hypothesized Î±
hyparchetype from which all first-recension manuscripts are now
thought to have been derived. **Add reference to Winroth article.**

Excommunication is discussed in the Sg version of C.4 d.init. in a
way that indicates that the concept is not an entirely settled one.
On the one hand, the phrase _in excommunione constitutus_ seems to
be used in the Sg text of the case statement as a legal technical
term: someone, like the accuser, who is said to be _in excommunione
constitutus_ seems to have been permanently excommunicated, while
the accused bishop is said to have been _suspenditur a communione_
(suspended from communion), by implication only temporarily, for
his failure to appear in court. On the other hand, the Sg version
of the case statement takes care to define excommunication: "id est
a communicatione privari (that is, to be deprived of communion)",
something the composer of the vulgate (Fr.) version of the case
statement does not find necessary.

The Sg version of C.4 d.init. uses the present tense, possibly
intended to be understood as historical present, consistently
throughout the case statement.

The MGH e-text edited by Reuter and Silagi introduced the OCR errors
**ait** into the text of the fifth question (_Quinto, an die
constituta non occurrens a communione **ait** remouendus?_) and
**indicio** into the text of the sixth question (_Sexto, si in
episcoporum **indicio** accusatoris persona culpabilis inuenta
fuerit ..._). The printed version of Friedberg correctly reads _a
communione **sit** remouendus_ and _in episcoporum **iudicio**_.

[^8]: Does the adjective _religiosum_ indicate that the accused
bishop is a member of the regular as opposed to the secular clergy?
What difference if any does this make with respect to the legal
issues raised by the case statement?

[^9]: It is not clear why _accusator_ is singular in Fr., especially
since the logic of the case statement leads the reader to expect a
plural reading. Verified as singular in Fr. (553), Ka (124vb), and
Kb (117va).

_quidam_: translate _quidam_ as a demonstrative adjective ("a certain
X") when it follows the noun it modifies; translate _quidam_ as an
article ("an X") when it precedes the noun it modifies, as is the
convention in modern European languages.

_substitui_ and _rescindi_: 3rd conjugation present passive infinitives.

_possit_ and _valeat_: translate _possit_ as "he can"; translate _valeat_
as "he is able to".

_Movet questionem_, _questionem mouet_: legal t.t., reappears in C.14
d.init.

Square brackets enclose words supplied in the translation.

There are eight noun-adjective pairs in the text of C.7 d.init. In
the Sg version of the text, the adjective follows the noun in all
but one instance: _Episcopus quidam_, _infirmitate longa_, _pontifex
romanus_, _episcopus idem_, _cathedram suam_, _episcopo vivente_,
_eadem ... ecclesia_, and _intercessione propria_. In the Fr.
version of the text, the adjective precedes the noun in all but one
instance: _Quidam ... episcopus_, _longa inualetudine_, _summus
Pontifex_, _idem episcopus_, _suam cathedram_, _uiuente episcopo_,
_ecclesia eadem_, and _sua intercessione_.

### Sg translation:

A cleric stirred up (_agitavit_) a question concerning estates against
[another] cleric whom he wished to bring before a civil judge. The
defendant did not wish to stand [trial] except before an ecclesiastical
judge; but the plaintiff (_actor_) drove him out from his possession
through the power of a civil judge. He, disregarding the sentence
of his bishop, administered his office, [and] the bishop, when he
found out about this, gave final judgement against him without hope
of reinstatement. It is asked therefore first, whether a cleric
ought to be brought before a civil judge? Second, if he ought not
to be brought forth, whether this fault is worthy of suspension.
Third, if it was not worthy, whether it is necessary that the one
in contempt be deposed irreparably by (lit. of) the sentence of his
bishop?

actor: this is the only occurrence in any form of the word actor
in the Sg version of the text of the case statements. (The word
actor also occurs exactly once in the Fr. version of the text of
the case statements, in the same place.) The initiator or initiators
of a legal action are far more frequently described in the case
statements using forms of the word accusator (10 occurrences in Sg,
and 18 occurrences in Fr.)

Ille contempta episcopi sui sententia offitium suum administravit,
hoc conperto episcopus sine spe restitucionis in eum sententiam
dedit: lit. He, the sentence of his bishop having been disregarded,
administered his office, this thing having been found out, the
bishop gave sentence against him without hope of restitution. The
Sg version of C.11 d.init. omits a crucial intermediate step from
the sequence of events in the narrative. In the Fr. version of the
narrative, when the plaintiff's bishop learns of his having litigated
his claim against a clerical defendant before a civil judge, he
suspends the plaintiff from the exercise of his ecclesiastical
duties. This is the sentence the plaintiff disregards.
