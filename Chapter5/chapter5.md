title: Case Statement Translations
---
In our January conversation, you indicated that I should produce
comparative translations of the Sg and Friedberg (vulgate) texts
of the case statements or *themata*.

The rationale for using Friedberg as the baseline for comparison
is that Winroth's edition in progress of the first recension is not
yet complete enough for the purpose. As of the most recent, 22 April
2019, version, eight case statements (for cases 1-3, 9, 15, 24, 30,
and 34) appear to have a complete critical apparatus. An addition
six case statements (for cases 4-7, 10, and 11) have an incomplete
critical apparatus that records variant readings from Fd only. The
critical apparatus for the case statement for case 35 records a
single variant reading from Aa. The remaining 21 case statements
(for cases 8, 12-14, 16-23, 25-29, 31-33, and 36) have no critical
apparatus at all.

Fortunately, the text of the case statements is fairly stable over
the course of development of the *Decretum* between its first
recension and vulgate versions. Winroth in the appendix to *The
Making of Gratian's Decretum* [@winroth_making_2000, 216] reports
only one significant variant reading for a case statement. The
first-recension version of C.19 d.init.  omits the phrase "unus
relicta propria ecclesia eo inuito, alter dimissa regulari canonica
cenobio se contulit." That the vulgate supplies the missing phrase
is meaningful because it makes sense of the fact that there are two
clerics in the story, an otherwise inexplicable feature of the
first-recension and Sg versions of the case statement. Textual
differences between the first-recension and vulgate versions of the
other case statements are relatively minor.  (e.g., "episcopus
minime concurrit" AaBcFdP versus "episcopus minime occurrit" Fr.
in C.4 d.init.)

This approach---applying the variants recorded in Winroth's appendix
to Friedberg's vulgate text to generate a stand-in or proxy for the
first recension---is consistent with the approach I have taken
throughout my dissertation project. Winroth himself took a similar
approach when he created the baseline text for the edition in
progress of the first recension (although he imposed a set of
orthographic conventions different from Friedberg's on the resulting
text). Regardless of how Winroth conceptualized what he was doing,
it is an approach that is well-theorized in a Digital Humanities
context as an example of "deformance." The term, proposed by Lisa
Samuels and Jerome McGann in "Deformance and Interpretation" (1999),
conflates the words "deformation" and "performance", and describes
a process through which a text is transformed by the application
of a series of deformances to generate a "paratext".
[@samuels_deformance_1999] The paratext is different from the
original text, but defined by the deformances through which it was
generated from it, and can be analyzed for otherwise unavailable
insights into the original text.
