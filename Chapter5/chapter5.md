When we had lunch on March 2, we discussed ways in which I might
compare the case statements with other conjecturally early strata
of the text of the Decretum. The hypothesized early strata we
discussed were the clusters of causae identified by Eichbauer in
the Sg manuscript on the basis of percentages of canons with rubrics.
(Cluster A = Causae 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, and 34; Cluster B
= Causae 5, 6, 12, 16, 18, and 21; etc.) I attempted a preliminary
analysis using the Friedberg text of the dicta from the Cluster A
causae as listed in Larrainzar's appendix to "El Borrador de la
'Concordia' de Graciano", hand-editing the text where necessary to
reflect the variant reading indicated by Larrainzar. In some cases,
he simply indicated that the text of the dictum in Sg was shorter
than in Fd (the only first-recension manuscript he appears to have
compared Sg with). In  those cases, I did not include the dictum
in my test sample. The results (see attached JPEG file) do not
appear to be interesting or significant, and I think the analysis
is going to require samples based directly on transcriptions from
Sg. I've started that process, but given the current state of my
vision, it's slow going.

It later occurred to me that it might be worthwhile to look at
another another conjecturally early stratum, the *dicta* in the
marriage *causae*. Noonan conjectured that we have particular reason
to believe that Gratian himself wrote the *dicta* in the marriage
*causae*. If we limit the sample to the *dicta* in the first-recension
version of the marriage *causae* (Noonan having been unaware of
existence of the first recension in 1979), this at least gives rise
to a hypothesis testable using the proxy first-recension text I've
been using. I'm in the process of setting this up now.

Noonan's reasoning is based on what could be considered an overly
close reading of *Sicut vetus testamentum*, which Noonan takes to
be the real summa of Paucapalea, as opposed to *Quoniam in omnibus*,
edited by Schulte as the summa of Paucapalea. *Sicut vetus testamentum*
refers to Gratian by name 18 times from C.27 on, but not before.
