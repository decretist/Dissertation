[Introduction to comparative translations of the Sg and Friedberg
(vulgate) texts of the case statements or *themata*.]

The rationale for using Friedberg as the baseline for comparison
is that Winroth's edition in progress of the first recension is not
yet complete enough for the purpose. As of the most recent, 22 April
2019, version, eight case statements (for cases 1-3, 9, 15, 24, 30,
and 34) appear to have a complete critical apparatus. An addition
six case statements (for cases 4-7, 10, and 11) have an incomplete
critical apparatus that records variant readings from Fd only. The
critical apparatus for the case statement for case 35 records a
single variant reading from Aa. The remaining 21 case statements
(for cases 8, 12-14, 16-23, 25-29, 31-33, and 36) have no critical
apparatus at all.

Fortunately, the text of the case statements is fairly stable over
the course of development of the *Decretum* between its first
recension and vulgate versions. Winroth in the appendix to *The
Making of Gratian's Decretum* [@winroth_making_2000, 216] reports
only one significant variant reading for a case statement. The
first-recension version of C.19 d.init. omits the phrase "unus
relicta propria ecclesia eo inuito, alter dimissa regulari canonica
cenobio se contulit." That the vulgate supplies the missing phrase
is meaningful because it makes sense of the fact that there are two
clerics in the story, an otherwise inexplicable feature of the
first-recension and Sg versions of the case statement. Textual
differences between the first-recension and vulgate versions of the
other case statements are relatively minor. (e.g., "episcopus
minime concurrit" AaBcFdP versus "episcopus minime occurrit" Fr.
in C.4 d.init.)

This approach---applying the variants recorded in Winroth's appendix
to Friedberg's vulgate text to generate a stand-in or proxy for the
first recension---is consistent with the approach I have taken
throughout my dissertation project. Winroth himself took a similar
approach when he created the baseline text for the edition in
progress of the first recension (although he imposed a set of
orthographic conventions different from Friedberg's on the resulting
text). Regardless of how Winroth conceptualized what he was doing,
it is an approach that is well-theorized in a Digital Humanities
context as an example of "deformance." The term, proposed by Lisa
Samuels and Jerome McGann in "Deformance and Interpretation" (1999),
conflates the words "deformation" and "performance", and describes
a process through which a text is transformed by the application
of a series of deformances to generate a "paratext".
[@samuels_deformance_1999] The paratext is different from the
original text, but defined by the deformances through which it was
generated from it, and can be analyzed for otherwise unavailable
insights into the original text.

### Sg

The primary focus of my dissertation has been on the textual
relationship between the case statements in Part II of Gratian's
*Decretum* and the first-recension *dicta*. As I have discussed at
some length in Chapter 4 above, the author of the case statements
appears unlikely to have been the same person as the author of the
first-recension *dicta*, the person we usually think of as Gratian.
The text of the case statements is relatively stable over the course
of the development of the *Decretum* from the first recension to
the vulgate. There is, however, another version of the text of the
case statements that needs to be considered, the one found in the
Sankt Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript of the *Decretum*.

The version of the *Decretum* preserved in Sg contains around a
thousand canons, and it is therefore considerably shorter than
either the first recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945)
versions of the text. ^[See @larrainzar_borrador_1999 for number
of canons in Sg, emphasizing that it is approximate. Pennington has
[1,050](http://legalhistorysources.com/Canon%20Law/ComparisonGratian.htm).
See @winroth_making_2000 for number of canons in first recension.
3,945 is a conventional number.]

Formally, Sg is not divided into parts; all of its content is
presented in the form of cases. The first case, however, unique to
Sg and referred to as Causa Prima to distinguish it from Causa I
found in the first recension and vulgate versions, contains a subset
of the canons found in Part I in other versions of the *Decretum*.
Sg has 33 cases, adding Causa Prima and omitting cases 24, 25, 26,
and 28.

The Sg version of the text of the case statements has 3,226 words,
shorter than but comparable to the first-recension and vulgate
versions (3,605 words confirm). The text of the 32 directly
corresponding case statements, removing C.Prima for Sg, and removing
C.24, 25, 26, and 28 for the vulgate, is slightly more compact in
Sg (3,173 words) than in the vulgate (3,312 words). **The Sg cases
statements are not more "verbose" than their vulgate counterparts.**
There are, however noticeable differences in vocabulary.

### Comparative Translation of C.19 d.init.

#### Sg text:

(144b) Volunt duo clerici ad monasterium transire. Petiit uterque
ab episcopo suo licentiam. Unde queritur, an debeat episcopus
permittere, ut propria ecclesia relicta, clericus monachus fiat?
Secundo, si episcopus dare licentiam noluerit, an eo invito monasterium
adire possit? Tertio, si contigerit ipsos regulares canonicos fuisse,
utrum monasterii ingressus eis esset concedendus?

#### Sg translation:

Two clerics want to transfer to a monastery. Each sought permission
from his bishop. Whence it is asked whether a bishop ought to permit
a cleric to become a monk after leaving his own church? Second, if
the bishop did not wish to give permission, whether the cleric can
enter a monastery against his wishes? Third, if it happened that
they had been canons regular, whether entry to a monastery should
have been granted to them. (Sg)

#### Fr. text:

(Fr. 839) Duo clerici ad monasterium transire uolunt; uterque
licentiam ab episcopo suo petiit; unus relicta propria ecclesia eo
inuito, alter dimissa regulari canonica cenobio se contulit. Modo
queritur, si episcopus debeat permittere, ut relicta propria ecclesia
clericus monasterium ingrediatur? Secundo queritur, si episcopus
licentiam dare noluerit, an eo inuito monasterium possit adire?
Tertio, si contigerit ipsos regulares canonicos fuisse, utrum
concedendus esset eis monasterii ingressus?

#### Fr. translation:

Two clerics want to transfer to a monastery; each sought permission
from his bishop; one after leaving his own church against the wishes
of his bishop, the other _dimissa regulari canonica_ betook himself
to a monastery. Now it is asked if a bishop ought to permit a cleric
to enter a monastery after leaving his own church? Second it is
asked, if the bishop did not wish to give permission, whether the
cleric can enter a monastery against his wishes? Third, if it
happened that they had been canons regular, whether entry to a
monastery should have been granted to them?

### Incipits to first questions

#### Sg

[Fully one-third---11 out of 33---of the incipits to first questions
in the Sg version of the case statements are unique.  The Friedberg
(vulgate) and Sg versions of incipits to first questions are identical
in only three out of 32 directly comparable case statements (those
for C.30 d.init., C.32 d.init., and C.33 d.init.).]
