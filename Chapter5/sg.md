The primary focus of my dissertation has been on the textual
relationship between the case statements in Part II of Gratian's
*Decretum* and the first-recension *dicta*. As I have discussed at
some length in Chapter 4 above, the author of the case statements
appears unlikely to have been the same person as the author of the
first-recension *dicta*, the person we usually think of as Gratian.
The text of the case statements is relatively stable over the course
of the development of the *Decretum* from the first recension to
the vulgate. There is, however, another version of the text of the
case statements that needs to be considered, the one found in the
Sankt Gallen Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) manuscript of the *Decretum*.

The version of the *Decretum* preserved in Sg contains around a
thousand canons, and it is therefore considerably shorter than
either the first recension (1,860 canons) or the vulgate (3,945)
versions of the text. ^[See @larrainzar_borrador_1999 for number
of canons in Sg, emphasizing that it is approximate. Pennington has
[1,050](http://legalhistorysources.com/Canon%20Law/ComparisonGratian.htm).
See @winroth_making_2000 for number of canons in first recension.
3,945 is a conventional number.]

Formally, Sg is not divided into parts; all of its content is
presented in the form of cases. The first case, however, unique to
Sg and referred to as Causa Prima to distinguish it from Causa I
found in the first recension and vulgate versions, contains a subset
of the canons found in Part I in other versions of the *Decretum*.
Sg has 33 cases, adding Causa Prima and omitting cases 24, 25, 26,
and 28.

The Sg version of the text of the case statements has 3,226 words,
shorter than but comparable to the first-recension and vulgate
versions (3,605 words confirm). The text of the 32 directly
corresponding case statements, removing C.Prima for Sg, and removing
C.24, 25, 26, and 28 for the vulgate, is slightly more compact in
Sg (3,173 words) than in the vulgate (3,312 words). **The Sg cases
statements are not more "verbose" than their vulgate counterparts.**
There are, however noticeable differences in vocabulary.
