# Conclusion

The purpose of this chapter in the original outline of my dissertation
limited and clearly defined: to show that there was no information
in the known biography of Gratian, either from findings of modern
scholars such as Noonan, Winroth, and Pennington, or from testimony
provided by near-contemporaries such as the authors of the prefaces
to 12th-century *summae* on the *Decretum*, that contradicted or
precluded the possibility that the case statements and *dicta* had
different authors. None of the near-contemporaries most plausibly
linked with Gratian and his project make an unambiguous claim to
have been his student or to have otherwise had first-hand knowledge
of the circumstances under which the *Decretum* was compiled.
Similarly, nothing in modern scholarship precludes or contradicts
the possibility that the *Decretum* was a product of collective or
group authorship. (Pennington has advanced an Occam's razor argument
against multiplying Gratians in the absence of compelling evidence
for their existence: *pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate*.
That is not the same as affirmatively arguing that the *dicta* in
Gratian's *Decretum* were written by a single author. The following
chapter offers what I hope Pennington will accept as sufficiently
persuasive evidence for collaborative or group authorship of the
*dicta*.)

In November 2014, early in the project, I reported on work in
progress at an event hosted by the Maryland Institute for Technology
in the Humanities (MITH). I explained the project in simplified
terms for a non-medievalist audience as an attempt to use computational
methods to resolve a long-standing debate between two leading figures
in the field over whether Gratian's *Decretum* was written by one
author or two. I then shared the preliminary finding that the results
of principal component analysis of the *dicta* were not compatible
with either the one-author or the two-author hypothesis. Neil
Fraistat, the director of MITH, observed: "if the answer doesn't
make sense, you're asking the wrong question." After thinking about
Fraistat's challenge over a span of many years, I eventually arrived
at an understanding of why it is asking the wrong question to ask
whether Gratian's *Decretum* was written by one author or two. As
a result, this chapter outgrew its original outline.

Modern historians tacitly assume a model of authorship more appropriate
to the study of twentieth-century literary works than to the study
of a complex scholastic text like the *Decretum*. (The image of
Hemingway typing the manuscript for a novel comes to mind.) They
have looked to near-contemporaries for evidence regarding the
authorship of the *Decretum*, again tacitly assuming that those
near-contemporaries understood authorship in the same way they do,
and that therefore whatever those witnesses had to say on the matter
could be understood in those terms. That does not appear to be the
case.

Modern historians and their sources have in some sense been talking
past each other.

Asking whether the Decretum has one or two authors will not result
in a meaningful answer, because it uncritically presupposes a
definition of "author" that is not meaningful when applied to a
text composed when, and under the intellectual and material
circumstances, the *Decretum* was.

<!--

Neither does the Hemingway model comport well with the way in which
authorship has been thought about in theoretically-informed literary
scholarship over the last half-century.
