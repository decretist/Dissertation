Chapter 3 overflow:

What we'd really like to have is evidence from one or more of his
students about the biography of Gratian and about the authorship
of the *Decretum*. The *Decretum* was a teaching text, and Gratian's
students had a front-row seat to its development. Unfortunately,
"the usual suspects" are all silent, strongly suggesting we have
the wrong "usual suspects," i.e., that Paucapalea, Omnibonus, and
Simon, etc., were not actually Gratian's students. We don't appear
to have anything from Gratian's actual students. If we want the
*ipsissima verba* of Gratian's actual students, we probably have
to look between the covers of the *Decretum* to find them.

Furthermore, Paucapalea in the preface to his *summa* clearly shows
both that he is aware of the third part of the *Decretum*, *de
Consecratione*, and that he uncritically accepts it as having been
compiled by the same Master responsible for the rest of the work:
"*In extremis de ecclesiarum dedicatione et corpore et sanguine
domini atque baptismo nec non et confirmatione pleniter tractat,
et in his suum tractatum terminat.* In the end, he treats fully the
dedication of churches, the body and blood of the Lord, baptism,
and also confirmation, and with these things concludes his
treatise."[^p]

[^p]: @paucapalea_summa_1890 [3]; @somerville_prefaces_1998 [184-185].

If Rambaud is correct that *de Consecratione* was not part of the
original *Decretum*, the fact that Paucapalea attributed it to the
same unnamed master responsible for rest of the text on which he
was commenting strongly suggests that he did not have direct knowledge
of Gratian or his plan of work.

The use Winroth makes of the Siena necrology in his argument that
Gratian could not have been the author of the second recension is
persuasive if and only if you believe *both* that the first recension
was competed not earlier than 1139 *and* that Gratian was a bishop
by 1143 and dead by 1145. It is, however, neither the only nor the
strongest argument against Gratian's authorship of the second
recension.

The debate over Sg was more tangential to Larson's and John Wei's
dissertations than to Eichbauer's, for which it was a central
concern.

+

Pennington says that the 99-distinction version of the *Decretum*
"reached the Iberian peninsula" in the form of Bc.
[@pennington_biography_2018, 366-367] Pennington does not unambiguously
say that he considers Bc to be of Iberian origin. Winroth, off the
record, considers Bc to be of Italian origin.

+

The subset of canons and *dicta* from Part I of the first recension
of the *Decretum* from which *Causa Prima* in the Sg manuscript is
composed is ordered, with the relatively insignificant exception
that the four canons corresponding to D.32 c.3, c.4, c.6, and c.7
are inserted between the canons corresponding to D.31 c.6 and D.31
c.7.[@larrainzar_borrador_1999, 653]

+

Pennington claims to be arguing that there was one Gratian, but is
in fact arguing that Gratian composed the *Decretum* incrementally
over the course of a teaching career spanning several decades, which
is not quite the same thing. Also, Pennington does not address
Winroth's content-based arguments in favor of the two-author
hypothesis (e.g., differences between the first and second recensions
in terms of the levels of sophistication in the use of Justinianic
Roman Law).
