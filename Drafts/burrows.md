### Burrows

Thus far, I've focused on Burrows's Delta. In the spirit of *de
mortuis nihil nisi bonum*, I have not been critical of the recently
(18 December 2019) deceased Burrows. Burrows was not a statistician
as, e.g., Mosteller and Wallace were. It is unclear to me how much
mathematical learning he had. Burrows was an English professor who
was interested in Restoration-era poetry. He had a toolkit, Microsoft
Excel, that he was comfortableÂ using, and he used the tools that
he found in that toolkit, such as mean and standard deviation. He
was not overly concerned as to whether his technique was mathematically
or statistically justified.
