## Organization

### Questions

The *dictum ante canonem* (abbreviated d.a.c.) and *dictum initiale*
(abbreviated d.init.) are special cases of *dicta* and, like the
*dictum post canonem*, were written by Gratian (i.e., the person
performing the author-function at that place in the text).

The emphasis of the discussion of *dicta ante* will necessarily be
on their function in the organization of Part II.  The questions
in Part II are formally coordinate with the distinctions in Part
I, *de Pen*. and Part III.

There are 8,371 words in the first-recension *dicta ante* in Part
II.  Four *dicta ante* (C.11 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17
q.3 d.a.c.1, and C.22 q.3 d.a.c.1) were added in their entirety to
the second recension, presumably because the questions they introduced
were not added to the *Decretum* until the second recension.[^14]
Two first-recension *dicta ante* were modified in the second
recension: 23 words were added to C.21 q.3 d.a.c.1, and 3 words
were added to C.29 q.1 d.a.c.1.In total, only 202 words were added
to the *dicta ante* in the second recension. Thus, the *dicta ante*
in Part II, like the case statements, are quite stable, displaying
very little change between the first and second recension.

[^14]: **Confirm**. If these questions are missing altogether in
the first recension, what is the relationship to the questions as
stated in the initial case statement?
