## Organization

The *Decretum* in the form that circulated after around 1150 (the
Köln Dombibliothek manuscripts 127 and 128 are good early examples)
has three parts. Contemporaries like Rufinus and Stephen of Tournai
understood the three parts to treat respectively of ministries,
business, and sacraments: "*primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis,
tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis.*"[^2o1]

The first part consists of 101 distinctions. The division of Part
I into distinctions is traditionally thought to have been made by
Paucapalea (fl. 1140s) rather than by Gratian. The division seems
to have taken some time to reach its final form: Pennington has
pointed out that there were 99-distinction versions of the first
recension,[@pennington_biography_2018, 366] and Rufinus writing in
the mid-1160s presumably about the second recension describes Part
I as "having been completed in one hundred
distinctions."[@somerville_prefaces_1998, 193] Groups of distinctions
form treatises within the work: the first twenty distinctions, for
example, form a treatise on laws (*tractatus de legibus*) that
explores the sources of law. Other topics covered include ecclesiastical
hierarchy and clerical discipline.

The second part consists of 36 cases, which are further subdivided
into 168 questions. Four of the questions, C.11 q.2, C.17 q.3, C.22
q.3, and C.29 q.1 are empty, and one, C.33 q.3, encapsulates a
treatise on penance (*tractatus de penitentia*, abbreviated *de
Pen.*) divided into seven distinctions.

The third part of the *Decretum* is a treatise on sacraments
(*tractatus de consecratione*, abbreviated *de Cons.*) divided into
five distinctions.[@winroth_making_2000, 5] The third part, *de
Consecratione*, is problematic in several ways. That *de Cons.*
is a very late addition is not in doubt---it is absent from all
first-recension manuscripts, nor was it included in the earliest
manuscripts of the more widely-circulated second-recension version
of the *Decretum*, as indicated by glosses found in the Gt, Pf, and
Tr manuscripts describing Gratian's work as "principally divided
into two parts."[^2o5]

**[Move all discussion of d.a.c. and d.init. into Organization.
Case statements or *themata* are a special case of *dicta* found
only in, and closely tied to the organization of, Part II.]**

**The *dictum ante canonem* (abbreviated d.a.c.) and *dictum initiale*
(abbreviated d.init.) are special cases of *dicta* and, like the
*dictum post canonem*, were written by Gratian (i.e., the person
performing the author-function at that place in the text). My most
important finding is that the author of the first-recension *dicta*
did not write the case statements. Gratian intended the case
statements to be memorable, not necessarily realistic.**

The key finding of the dissertation is that the case statements
were written by someone other than the author(s) of the first-recension
*dicta*. The emphasis of the discussion of *dicta ante* will therefore
necessarily be on their function in the organization of Part II.
The questions in Part II are formally coordinate with the distinctions
in Part I, *de Pen*. and Part III. That is, they contain a single
terminal node (the *dictum ante*), followed by an ordered sequence
of one or more internal nodes (the chapters) containing inscription,
rubric, canon and *dictum post* terminal nodes.[^dac1]

Distinctions are the highest-order containers in Part I, *de Pen*.
and Part III.

There are 8,371 words in the first-recension dicta ante in Part II.
Four *dicta ante* (C.11 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.3
d.a.c.1, and C.22 q.3 d.a.c.1) were added in their entirety to the
second recension, presumably because the questions they introduced
were not added to the *Decretum* until the second recension.[^dac2]
Two first-recension dicta ante were modified in the second recension:
23 words were added to C.21 q.3 d.a.c.1, and 3 words were added to
C.29 q.1 d.a.c.1.In total, only 202 words were added to the dicta
ante in the second recension. Thus, the dicta ante in Part II,
like the case statements, are quite stable, displaying very little
change between the first and second recension.

The hypothetical case statements or *themata* that introduce each
of the thirty-six *causae* (cases) that constitute the second part
of the *Decretum* reflect at least in some places an outlook and a
set of concerns that university-educated urban professionals of the
present day would not find it difficult to identify with. At a time
when considerable attention is being paid in the realm of popular
discourse (if not yet public policy) to the issue of "opportunity
hoarding" on behalf of upper- and upper-middle class children by
their university-educated, urban professional parents, the intense
concern of "a certain man" in the first case statement to secure a
good ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness on more
than one occasion to resort to bribery in order to realize that
objective) has a distinctly contemporary feel to it.[^2o6]

In other cases, the hypothetical case statements are quite remote
from our own concerns. In case 28, for example, a married infidel,
by which Gratian means a Muslim, converts to Christianity. As a
result, his wife separates from him out of hatred for his new faith.
The convert then takes a new Christian wife, and after she dies,
he is made a priest. Finally, "on account of the merit of his life
and learning," he is elected bishop. Gratian extracts questions
from this fantastical fact-pattern, however, that are of considerable
theoretical, though perhaps not practical, interest: whether there
can be marriage between infidels, whether there is ever a situation
in which a man can take another wife if his previous wife is still
alive; and whether someone who had one wife before he was baptized
and another wife after he was baptized should be considered a
bigamist.

[^2o1]: Rufinus and Stephen of Tournai describe the tripartite
division in exactly the same words: "librum suum in tribus partibus
distinguit, quarum primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis, tertiam
ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis." [@singer_summa_1963, 5] "he
divides his book into three parts, the first of which he devotes
to ecclesiastical ministries, the second to [ecclesiastical] business,
and the third to ecclesiastical sacraments." [@somerville_prefaces_1998,
192-193] (Rufinus) "Harum primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis,
tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis." [@schulte_summa_1965,
6] "The first of these parts is devoted to ecclesiastical ministries,
the second to ecclesiastical problems, the third to ecclesiastical
sacraments." [@somerville_prefaces_1998, 201] (Stephen of Tournai)
(Brasington translated the preface of Rufinus, Somerville that of
Stephen of Tournai. [@somerville_prefaces_1998, vii]. There is no
indication as to why Somerville chose to translate *negotiis* as
"problems" rather than "business".)

    Given the probable dates of the *summae* of Rufinus (1164) and
    Stephen of Tournai (1165/66), it is just possible that Stephen
    got the wording from the preface to the *Summa* of Rufinus.

    Stephen, however, had been a student of Rufinus in Bologna, and
    it seems more likely that this is something he had heard Rufinus
    say in lecture. **Kenneth Pennington, "Étienne of Tournai".**

[^2o5]: **Need footnote on Gt, Pf, and Tr gloss**

[^2o6]: "Quidam habens filium ..." C.1, d.init., edF. 1.357. Although
Gratian does not say so explicitly, I think that we can reasonably
infer that the father is an urban merchant or professional, rather
than a member of the landed aristocracy, since his wealth, the
source of several bribes, is so readily convertible into cash.

[^dac1]: Add footnote restating distinction between canon and
chapter.

[^dac2]: **Confirm**. If these questions are missing altogether in
the first recension, what is the relationship to the questions as
stated in the initial case statement?
