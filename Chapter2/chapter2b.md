## Presentation

Having considered how Gratian sourced and collected his materials---the
question of what canons are and where Gratian got them---we now
turn to the question of how Gratian presented and organized the
canons he had collected. Here, it is important to distinguish between
presentation, the small-grain or micro structure of the *Decretum*,
and organization, the large-grain or macro structure of the *Decretum*.
The organization of the *Decretum* is very regular, so structurally
regular, in fact, that Reuter and Silagi's OCP e-text of the Friedberg
edition can be taken apart using a recursive descent parser, and
should be thought of as a sequence of hierarchically nested containers.
Taking a bottom-up approach, we will turn first to the presentation
or small-grain structure, and start with the canons, the atomic
containers out of which the higher-order containers---parts,
distinctions, cases, and questions---in the *Decretum* are built
up.

The way in which canons are presented in the *Decretum* differs
somewhat from the way in which they are presented in the predecessor
collections of formal sources from which Gratian selected his
material. The canon package in the formal sources typically included
an inscription, a rubric, and the canon text. Gratian added to the
package a *dictum post canonem* containing his own commentary on
the preceding canon or canons, a feature borrowed from Alger of
Liège's theological treatise *De misericordia et iustitia*, but
without an immediate precedent in the canonical literature.

* * *

A canon is often, though not always, introduced by a rubric, which
is a very short summary of what the canon is about. In 398 cases
(wrong number), the rubric just says "*de eodem*", which means
"about the same thing" (as the canon before). Most canons have an
inscription, which identifies the authority that is the source for
the canon (usually a papal decretal, a canon from an ecumenical
council or a provincial synod, or a patristic text).[^32] Because
Gratian was getting his texts from previous collections, the
inscription was frequently incorrect, especially if the text in
question was one that had been included in the Pseudo-Isidorian
forgeries. This raises the need to distinguish between Gratian's
material sources -- the original letter of Pope Gregory I, for
example -- and his formal sources -- the collection Gratian was
actually looking at when copying his text.[^33] Finally, there are
the *dicta* (literally, "things having been said"), which are
statements Gratian is making on his own authority as a jurist. It
is the *dicta* that carry the thread of Gratian's argument. [Here
I am only talking about *dicta post canones*. Dicta ante canones
are not part of the canon container but instead part of the distinction
or question container (always d.a.c.1 or equivalent). There are
three kinds of dicta: d.init (first leaf node of case or *causa*
container), d.a.c. (first leaf node of distinction or question
container), and d.p.c. (optional last leaf of canon container).
Dicta are text that Gratian (whoever we think he is) actually wrote
and are therefore subject to function word analysis for authorship
attribution.]

"The *dicta* in Gratian's *Decretum* bring the reader closer to its
author than any other part of the text."[@winroth_making_2000, 187]

The hypothetical case statements or *themata* that introduce each
of the thirty-six *causae* (cases) that constitute Part II of the
*Decretum* reflect at least in places an outlook and a set of
concerns that university-educated urban professionals of the present
day would not find it difficult to identify with. At a time when
considerable attention is being paid in the realm of popular discourse
(if not yet public policy) to the issue of "opportunity hoarding"
on behalf of upper- and upper-middle class children by their
university-educated, urban professional parents, the intense concern
of "a certain man" in the first case statement to secure a good
ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness on more than
one occasion to resort to bribery in order to realize that objective)
has a distinctly contemporary feel to it.[^34]

## Organization

The *Decretum* in the form that circulated after around 1150 (the
Köln Dombibliothek manuscripts 127 and 128 are good early examples)
has three parts. The first part consists of 101 distinctions. Groups
of distinctions form treatises within the work: distinctions 1-20,
for example, form a treatise on laws (*tractatus de legibus*) that
explores the sources of law. Other topics covered include ecclesiastical
hierarchy and clerical discipline. The second part consists of 36
cases. A treatise on penance (*tractatus de penitentia*) is attached
to the third question of case 33. The third part of the *Decretum*
is a treatise on sacraments (*tractatus de consecratione*).
[@winroth_making_2000, 5]

Contemporaries like Rufinus and Stephen of Tournai understood the
parts to treat respectively of ministries, business or problems,
and sacraments: "... he divides his book into three parts, the first
of which he devotes to ecclesiastical ministries, the second to
[ecclesiastical] business, and the third to ecclesiastical sacraments."
(Rufinus)[@somerville_prefaces_1998, 192-193] "The first of these
parts is devoted to ecclesiastical ministries, the second to
ecclesiastical problems, the third to ecclesiastical sacraments."
(Stephen of Tournai)[@somerville_prefaces_1998, 201]

The cases are hypotheticals like those used in modern law schools,
and some of them are quite far-fetched. In case 28, for example, a
married infidel converts to Christianity, as a result of which his
wife separates from him out of hatred for his new faith. (By
"infidel," Gratian means a Muslim.) The convert then takes a new
Christian wife, and after she dies, he is made a priest. Finally,
"on account of the merit of his life and learning," he is elected
bishop. Gratian extracts questions from this fantastical fact-pattern,
however, that are of considerable theoretical (if not practical)
interest: whether there can be marriage between infidels, whether
there is ever a situation in which a man can take another wife if
his previous wife is still alive; and whether someone who had one
wife before he was baptized and another wife after he was baptized
should be considered a bigamist.

The third part, *de Consecratione*, is problematic in several ways.
That *de Cons.* is a very late addition is not in doubt -- it is
absent from all first-recension (R1) manuscripts, nor was it included
in the earliest manuscripts of the more widely circulated
second-recension (R2) version of the *Decretum* as indicated by
glosses found in the Gt, Pf, and Tr manuscripts describing Gratian's
work as "principally divided into two parts."

[^32]: The distinction between rubrics and *dicta* is blurry:
"Gratian rarely took his rubrics from earlier collections. Rather
he created his own and often melded the rubrics with the dicta."
[@eichbauer_redactions_2007, 107] "Both J. Rambaud-Buhot and John
Noonan, Jr. have highlighted the similarity between dicta and
rubrics, that is, a rubric very often echoes the dictum that
immediately preceded it." and "These isolated instances in the first
cluster show that Gratian felt that the dictum was sufficient for
summarizing the following *auctoritas*." [@eichbauer_redactions_2007,
115] **Expand to include inscriptions.**

[^33]: "Since Gratian frequently took fragments of letters from the
Register of Gregory I---266 in all---using the inscription 'in
registro', older research assumed that he must have used this
important source in the form of the *Registrum Hadrianum*. According
to more recent research (Landau), even these texts from the Register
of Gregory I found in Gratian derive almost without exception from
canonical collections predating Gratian; the direct use of the
Register is probable in only a single case." [C.27 q.1 c.19 (JE
1496)] [@landau_gratian_2008, 34].

[^34]: "Quidam habens filium ..." C.1, d.init., edF. 1.357. Although
Gratian does not say so explicitly, I think that we can reasonably
infer that the father is an urban merchant or professional, rather
than a member of the landed aristocracy, since his wealth, the
source of several bribes, is so readily convertible into cash.
