[Here I am only talking about *dicta post canones*. Dicta ante
canones are not part of the canon container but instead part of the
distinction or question container (always d.a.c.1 or equivalent).
There are three kinds of dicta: d.init (first leaf node of case or
*causa* container), d.a.c. (first leaf node of distinction or
question container), and d.p.c. (optional last leaf of canon
container).]

The hypothetical case statements or *themata* that introduce each
of the thirty-six *causae* (cases) that constitute Part II of the
*Decretum* reflect at least in places an outlook and a set of
concerns that university-educated urban professionals of the present
day would not find it difficult to identify with. At a time when
considerable attention is being paid in the realm of popular discourse
(if not yet public policy) to the issue of "opportunity hoarding"
on behalf of upper- and upper-middle class children by their
university-educated, urban professional parents, the intense concern
of "a certain man" in the first case statement to secure a good
ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness on more than
one occasion to resort to bribery in order to realize that objective)
has a distinctly contemporary feel to it.[^34]

The cases are hypotheticals like those used in modern law schools,
and some of them are quite far-fetched. In case 28, for example, a
married infidel converts to Christianity, as a result of which his
wife separates from him out of hatred for his new faith. (By
"infidel," Gratian means a Muslim.) The convert then takes a new
Christian wife, and after she dies, he is made a priest. Finally,
"on account of the merit of his life and learning," he is elected
bishop. Gratian extracts questions from this fantastical fact-pattern,
however, that are of considerable theoretical (if not practical)
interest: whether there can be marriage between infidels, whether
there is ever a situation in which a man can take another wife if
his previous wife is still alive; and whether someone who had one
wife before he was baptized and another wife after he was baptized
should be considered a bigamist.

The third part, *de Consecratione*, is problematic in several ways.
That *de Cons.* is a very late addition is not in doubt -- it is
absent from all first-recension (R1) manuscripts, nor was it included
in the earliest manuscripts of the more widely circulated
second-recension (R2) version of the *Decretum* as indicated by
glosses found in the Gt, Pf, and Tr manuscripts describing Gratian's
work as "principally divided into two parts."

[^34]: "Quidam habens filium ..." C.1, d.init., edF. 1.357. Although
Gratian does not say so explicitly, I think that we can reasonably
infer that the father is an urban merchant or professional, rather
than a member of the landed aristocracy, since his wealth, the
source of several bribes, is so readily convertible into cash.
