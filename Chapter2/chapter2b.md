## Presentation

Having considered how Gratian sourced and collected his materials---the
question of what canons are and where Gratian got them---we now
turn to the question of how Gratian presented and organized the
canons he had collected. Here, it is important to distinguish between
presentation, the small-grain or micro structure of the *Decretum*,
and organization, the large-grain or macro structure of the *Decretum*.
The organization of the *Decretum* is very regular, so structurally
regular, in fact, that Reuter and Silagi's OCP e-text of the Friedberg
edition can be taken apart using a recursive descent parser, and
should be thought of as a sequence of hierarchically nested containers.
Taking a bottom-up approach, we will turn first to the presentation
or small-grain structure, and start with the canons, the atomic
containers out of which the higher-order containers---parts,
distinctions, cases, and questions---in the *Decretum* are built
up.

The way in which canons are presented in the *Decretum* differs
somewhat from the way in which they are presented in the predecessor
collections of formal sources from which Gratian selected his
material. The canon package in the formal sources typically included
an inscription, a rubric, and the canon text. Gratian added to the
package a *dictum post canonem* containing his own commentary on
the preceding canon or canons, a feature borrowed from Alger of
Liège's theological treatise *De misericordia et iustitia*, but
without an immediate precedent in the canonical literature.

A canon is often, though not always, introduced by a rubric. The
name refers to the fact that rubrics were conventionally written
in red ink in manuscripts. A rubric is a very short summary of what
the following canon is about. In many cases the rubric simply reads
"*de eodem*", which means "about the same thing" as the preceding
canon.[^32]

Most canons have an inscription, which identifies the ultimate
source of authority for that canon, usually a papal decretal, a
canon from an ecumenical council or an important provincial synod,
or a patristic text.[^33] This raises the need to distinguish
Gratian's material sources---an original letter of Pope Gregory I,
for example---from his formal sources---the collection from which
Gratian actually copied his text.[^34] Because Gratian collected
his texts almost exclusively from formal sources, the inscription
was frequently historically inaccurate, especially if the text in
question was one derived from the Pseudo-Isidorian collections.

Finally, there are the *dicta post canones* (singular *dictum post
canonem*), usually abbreviated d.p.c., and literally meaning
"something said after the canon". The *dicta post* are statements
that Gratian made on his own authority as a jurist, carry the thread
of his argument, and do his interpretive work. The *dicta* are texts
that Gratian (whether we think of him as one person or many) actually
wrote, and are therefore subject to analysis for authorship
attribution. "The *dicta* in Gratian's *Decretum* bring the reader
closer to its author than any other part of the
text."[@winroth_making_2000, 187]

## Organization

The *Decretum* in the form that circulated after around 1150 (the
Köln Dombibliothek manuscripts 127 and 128 are good early examples)
has three parts. The first part consists of 101 distinctions. Groups
of distinctions form treatises within the work: the first twenty
distinctions, for example, form a treatise on laws (*tractatus de
legibus*) that explores the sources of law. Other topics covered
include ecclesiastical hierarchy and clerical discipline. The second
part consists of 36 cases. A treatise on penance (*tractatus de
penitentia*) is inserted in the second part at C.33 q.3. The third
part of the *Decretum* is a treatise on sacraments (*tractatus de
consecratione*).[@winroth_making_2000, 5]

Contemporaries like Rufinus and Stephen of Tournai understood the
parts to treat respectively of ministries, business or problems,
and sacraments: "*librum suum in tribus partibus distinguit, quarum
primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis, tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat
sacramentis.* (p.5) (he divides his book into three parts, the first
of which he devotes to ecclesiastical ministries, the second to
[ecclesiastical] business, and the third to ecclesiastical
sacraments.)"[@somerville_prefaces_1998, 192-193] (Rufinus) "*Harum
primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis, tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat
sacramentis.* (p.6) ("The first of these parts is devoted to
ecclesiastical ministries, the second to ecclesiastical problems,
the third to ecclesiastical sacraments."[@somerville_prefaces_1998,
201] (Stephen of Tournai)

* * *

[Here I am only talking about *dicta post canones*. Dicta ante
canones are not part of the canon container but instead part of the
distinction or question container (always d.a.c.1 or equivalent).
There are three kinds of dicta: d.init (first leaf node of case or
*causa* container), d.a.c. (first leaf node of distinction or
question container), and d.p.c. (optional last leaf of canon
container).]

The hypothetical case statements or *themata* that introduce each
of the thirty-six *causae* (cases) that constitute Part II of the
*Decretum* reflect at least in places an outlook and a set of
concerns that university-educated urban professionals of the present
day would not find it difficult to identify with. At a time when
considerable attention is being paid in the realm of popular discourse
(if not yet public policy) to the issue of "opportunity hoarding"
on behalf of upper- and upper-middle class children by their
university-educated, urban professional parents, the intense concern
of "a certain man" in the first case statement to secure a good
ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness on more than
one occasion to resort to bribery in order to realize that objective)
has a distinctly contemporary feel to it.[^39]

The cases are hypotheticals like those used in modern law schools,
and some of them are quite far-fetched. In case 28, for example, a
married infidel converts to Christianity, as a result of which his
wife separates from him out of hatred for his new faith. (By
"infidel," Gratian means a Muslim.) The convert then takes a new
Christian wife, and after she dies, he is made a priest. Finally,
"on account of the merit of his life and learning," he is elected
bishop. Gratian extracts questions from this fantastical fact-pattern,
however, that are of considerable theoretical (if not practical)
interest: whether there can be marriage between infidels, whether
there is ever a situation in which a man can take another wife if
his previous wife is still alive; and whether someone who had one
wife before he was baptized and another wife after he was baptized
should be considered a bigamist.

The third part, *de Consecratione*, is problematic in several ways.
That *de Cons.* is a very late addition is not in doubt -- it is
absent from all first-recension (R1) manuscripts, nor was it included
in the earliest manuscripts of the more widely circulated
second-recension (R2) version of the *Decretum* as indicated by
glosses found in the Gt, Pf, and Tr manuscripts describing Gratian's
work as "principally divided into two parts."

[^32]: **The role of the *de eodem* rubrics in Winroth's argument
that the Aa, Bc, Fd, and P mss. of the *Decretum* are a first
recension rather than an abbreviation of the vulgate.
[@winroth_making_2000] Kuttner's statement of the "untidy seams"
problem in "Acta and Agenda", and how Winroth solves it.
[@kuttner_research_1990] Winroth's frequently-cited and incorrect
claim that there are 398 *de eodem* rubrics, a cautionary tale about
the care needed when approaching electronic resources.**

[^33]: The distinction between rubrics and *dicta* is blurry:
"Gratian rarely took his rubrics from earlier collections. Rather
he created his own and often melded the rubrics with the dicta."
[@eichbauer_redactions_2007, 107] "Both J. Rambaud-Buhot and John
Noonan, Jr. have highlighted the similarity between dicta and
rubrics, that is, a rubric very often echoes the dictum that
immediately preceded it." and "These isolated instances in the first
cluster show that Gratian felt that the dictum was sufficient for
summarizing the following *auctoritas*." [@eichbauer_redactions_2007,
115] **Expand to include inscriptions.**

[^34]: "Since Gratian frequently took fragments of letters from the
Register of Gregory I---266 in all---using the inscription 'in
registro', older research assumed that he must have used this
important source in the form of the *Registrum Hadrianum*. According
to more recent research (Landau), even these texts from the Register
of Gregory I found in Gratian derive almost without exception from
canonical collections predating Gratian; the direct use of the
Register is probable in only a single case." [C.27 q.1 c.19 (JE
1496)] [@landau_gratian_2008, 34].

[^39]: "Quidam habens filium ..." C.1, d.init., edF. 1.357. Although
Gratian does not say so explicitly, I think that we can reasonably
infer that the father is an urban merchant or professional, rather
than a member of the landed aristocracy, since his wealth, the
source of several bribes, is so readily convertible into cash.
