The first treatise, on the sources of law (*tractatus de legibus*),
corresponds to distinctions 1-20.[^6] The second treatise, on the
ecclesiastical hierarchy and clerical discipline, corresponds to
distinctions 21-80. Gratian explicitly refers to this treatise at
several other places in the *Decretum* using the title *tractatus
ordinandorum*.[^7] Gratian at D.81 d.a.c.1 indicates that the
material corresponding to distinctions 81-101 is separate from, but
in some sense supplemental to, the *tractatus ordinandorum*.
