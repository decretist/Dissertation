  The second order of business is to discuss Winroth's findings and
  explain that you will concentrate on what he proposed was the
  first recension. I think the explanation for this focus is that
  the discovery of the first recension opens up questions about how
  the second recension developed. The conjecture that the first
  recension had one author—as W surmises—and that the second might
  have had several is natural. You want to explore the question of
  whether the first Gratian was in fact one person. Having done
  that, one could then move on to study the nature of W's Gratian
