subtitle: The *Decretum*
---
The *Decretum* represents a towering intellectual achievement of
the renaissance of the twelfth century that ushered in the high
middle ages in Europe. But whose achievement was it? In particular,
is the *Decretum* the achievement of a single author or was it the
product of serial or even collaborative authorship? Because so
little is reliably known about the historical Gratian, and because
almost everything that previous generations thought was known about
Gratian has proved, on closer examination, to be
myth,[@noonan_gratian_1979] it is best to make our first approach
(*accessus*) to the author through his text.[^2] The approach is
made more difficult by the fact that, like many modern university
textbooks, the *Decretum* underwent at least one major revision,
and was probably the product of a process of continuous revision.

In 1996, Anders Winroth discovered that four surviving twelfth-century
manuscripts -- Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. Soppr.
A. 1.402 (Fd); Barcelona, Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó, Santa Maria
de Ripoll 78 (Bc); Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles
acquisitions latines 1761 (P); and Admont, Stiftsbibliothek 23 and
43 (Aa) -- preserve the text of what Winroth called the first
recension of the *Decretum*.[^3] In 1998, Carlos Larrainzar identified
Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, latin 3884 I, fo. 1 (Pfr)
as a one-page fragment of a first-recension manuscript of the
*Decretum*.[@winroth_making_2000, 32] And in 2011, Atria Larson
discovered that München, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, lat. 22272
(Mw) contains an abbreviation of the first recension of the
*Decretum*.[@larson_abbreviatio_2011]

**The four first-recension manuscripts were previously thought to
be abbreviations, and are about half the length of the vulgate
*Decretum*.**
^["The second recension contains 3,945 canons (including the paleae)
in the editions. The first recension contains only 1,860 canons (47
percent)." [@winroth_making_2000, 122] The division of distinctions
and questions into canons is a matter of editorial opinion and
therefore unavoidably conventional. The generally-cited number of
3,945 comes from Friedberg's introduction (edF 1.xii). Furthermore,
many canons include more than one canon text, and the conventional
number obfuscates the distinction between the canon defined as a
container or package and the canon text or texts included within
it. The Reuter and Silagi e-text of the Friedberg edition has 3,848
canons (identified by the OCP ```<4 N>``` tag, where N is the canon
number) containing 4,394 distinct canon texts (identified by the
OCP ```<T T>``` tag). **Note to PLE: ```egrep "<T T>.*<T T>"
edF.txt``` to find the three lines where the canon text tag occurs
twice on the same line.**]

Winroth's discovery of the first recension suggests one obvious way
in which it might be problematic to refer simplistically to Gratian
as the author of the *Decretum,* as I have done thus far.[^6] Winroth
rejects any presumption of monolithic authorship on stratigraphic
grounds. He argues that the first recension is "coherent and
complete," and that its author intentionally released it into
circulation as a "finished product."[^7] (In other words, it did
not just prematurely escape into the wild like parts of Augustine's
*de Trinitate*.) Winroth thinks of the first and second recensions
as distinct textual layers and argues that two different authors
(Gratian 1 and Gratian 2) compiled the two recensions.[^8]

Several decades before Winroth discovered the first recension of
the Decretum and argued that the Gratian of the first recension was
not necessarily the same as the Gratian of the second recension,
John Noonan pointed out another obvious way in which it might be
problematic to conceptualize the *Decretum* as the product of
monolithic authorship. As was noted briefly above and will be
discussed in further detail below, the second recension of the
*Decretum* had three distinct parts. Noonan warned that the Gratian
of Part I was not necessarily the same as the Gratian of Part II
or Part III. (And in point of fact, the Gratian of Part III, the
compiler of *de Consecratione*, is very unlikely to have been the
same as the Gratian of Parts I and II.) Furthermore, nothing logically
excludes the possibility that Winroth and Noonan are both right and
that the Gratian of the first-recension version of Part I is not
necessarily the same as the Gratian of the second-recension version
of Part I, and so on through all the possible permutations and
combinations of recensions (first and second) and parts (I, II, and
III).[^9]

But long before the discovery of the first recension in the late
twentieth century, the first twelfth-century readers of the *Decretum*
were distinctly aware of the limited extent to which it could be
thought of as the work of a single author. Even early readers, such
as Stephen of Tournai and the author of the *Summa Parisiensis*,
who implicitly endorsed the single author theory by subsuming the
entire vulgate text of the *Decretum* under the eponym "Gratian,"
recognized that whoever Gratian was, he was not directly responsible
either for the bulk of the text or for certain notable formal
features of the work, like the division of Part I into
*distinctiones*.[^10] Gratian was working within a well-established
genre of academic writing in medieval Latin literature, the canonical
collection.[^11] The *Decretum* followed in the footsteps of any
number of systematic canonical collections in which the material
was organized by topic that had been in circulation since the
beginning of the eleventh century.[^12]

Twelfth-century readers of a canonical collection did not necessarily
expect all (or even any) of the words they read to have been written
by the author. They expected instead to find the distinctive
contribution of the author in the selection, editing, and arrangement
of words not his own: canons of councils, decrees of popes, and
extracts from patristic authorities and secular law, often accompanied
by traditional inscriptions ascribing the texts (accurately or
inaccurately) to recognized authoritative sources. Gratian met this
expectation. Around four-fifths of the text of the vulgate *Decretum*
comes from the tradition of canonical texts accumulated over the
first millennium of the church's history. An extremely important
part of the authorial activity of Gratian, then, did consist precisely
in the collection and selection of material from the canonical
tradition and in his presentation and organization of the texts
that he had collected and selected.

If the author of a canonical collection had anything to say on his
own authority, he was expected to do so in a prologue. The Prologue
of Ivo of Chartres, for example, was a work of considerable theoretical
sophistication that continued to circulate independently and find
an audience even after Gratian's *Decretum* superseded the collections
to which it had originally been prepended.[^13] In this respect,
Gratian did not conform to the expectations of the genre in which
he was working. For starters, he did not include a preface, something
that did not escape the somewhat disapproving notice of contemporaries
like the author of the *Summa Parisiensis*.

In presenting and organizing the canonical texts that he had selected,
however, Gratian added a significant amount of first-person commentary
(*dicta*), amounting to around one-fifth (or eighty thousand words)
of the vulgate *Decretum*. Gratian's commentary is what binds the
*Decretum* together into a coherent whole, and his *dicta* form the
backbone of the arguments that he makes. The *dicta* (sayings) are
a feature that Gratian borrowed from another genre, the theological
treatise, specifically Alger of Liège's *De misericordia et iustitia*.
In addition to the *dicta*, Gratian also wrote the rubrics, so-called
because they were written in red ink in manuscripts of the *Decretum*.
The rubrics are one-line summaries of canons that they introduce.

As a first-order approximation, then, Gratian could be considered
the author, in the modern sense of the word, of the *dicta* and
rubrics, and the compiler and arranger of the canons and inscriptions.
(In practice, *dicta*, inscriptions, and rubrics cannot be distinguished
quite so cleanly as we would like: dicta sometimes trail off into
inscriptions, and rubrics and inscriptions are sometimes poorly
separated.[^14]) But, as Noonan further pointed out, the Gratian
who compiled, arranged, and edited the canons and inscriptions was
not necessarily the same as the person who wrote the *dicta*, who
in turn was not necessarily the same as the person who created the
rubrics.[^15] All of these considerations suggest that the presumption
that the *Decretum* was the product of a single author ought to be
entertained with extreme caution. As I turn my attention to the
collection and selection, presentation, and organization of the
canonical texts found in the *Decretum*, I will continue to use the
name Gratian as a conventional label for its author or authors,
while withholding judgment as to whether one person or many stand
behind the name

## Collection and Selection

A canon is an authoritative text, or an excerpt from one, that
provides a rule or norm for Christian life, either for an individual
Christian believer in their clerical or lay station, or for the
Church corporately, at whatever level -- local church or religious
foundation, diocese, province, or the universal Church. The Greek
work *kanon* literally means a ruler or straightedge used to mark
a line, and Christian believers individually and the Church corporately
follow a straight path when they follow the rules marked out by the
*kanones*. "*Canon grece, latine regula nuncupatur. Regula dicta
est eo quod recte ducit, nec aliquando aliorsum trahit. Alii dixerunt
regulam dictam, vel quod regat, vel normam recte vivendi prebeat,
vel quod distortum pravumque est corrigat.* ('Canon' is Greek for
what is called a 'rule' in Latin. It is called a rule because it
leads one aright and never takes one astray. But others say that
it is called a rule because it rules, presents a norm for right
living, or sets aright what is twisted and bent.)"[^16] The late
first- or early second-century *Didache* is an example of a very
early Christian text that contains such rules or norms. After the
official recognition of Christianity by Constantine in 313, the
Church had a greater need for an agreed-upon set of rules. Such
rules were provided by the canons of provincial and ecumenical
councils, and somewhat later by papal decretals.

Gratian, strictly speaking, defines canons as either *decreta
Pontificum* ("decrees of pontiffs") or *statuta conciliorum*
("statutes of councils").[^17] From a relatively early date, the
bishops of Rome had cultivated the practice of issuing decretal
letters, consciously modeled after Roman imperial rescripts, in
which they laid down disciplinary and doctrinal norms in response
to questions put to them, usually by other bishops.[^18] The earliest
surviving example is a letter from Pope Siricius (†399) to Bishop
Himerius of Tarragona, written in 385 in response to a letter that
Himerius had sent to Siricius's predecessor, Pope Damasus (†384).[^19]
The letter, sometimes referred to by the first word of its text as
the *Directa* decretal, remains an important source for norms
concerning clerical celibacy in late antiquity. The most familiar
example for modern readers of an imperial rescript, the genre after
which the papal decretal letter was modeled, is the early second-century
(ca. 112) response of the emperor Trajan (†117) to a letter from
Pliny the Younger inquiring as to how Pliny, then Roman provincial
governor of Bithynia and Pontus, ought to proceed against those
accused of being Christians.

Another extremely important source for the *Decretum* is canons
from the ecumenical councils and from historically important
provincial synods: *Conciliorum vero alia sunt universalia, alia
provincialia*. ("Some councils are universal, others provincial.")[^20]
Although the Council of Nicaea (325) is primarily remembered for
its doctrinal settlement, memorialized in the Nicene Creed, of the
Arian controversy over the divine nature of Christ, it also promulgated
twenty canons of a disciplinary nature. Provincial synods tended
to assume an outsized importance in the canonical tradition when
figures such as Augustine of Hippo (†430) or Caesarius of Arles
(†542) either participated in or presided over them: "*Etiam S.
Augustinus Yponensis episcopus in eadem sinodo legitur fuisse."*
(It is read that St. Augustine, bishop of Hippo, also attended this
synod.)"[^21] By the time the *Decretum* was compiled, the cumulative
output of the ecumenical councils and provincial synods amounted
to a considerable mass of material, and Gratian devoted most of
*Distinctiones* 15 and 16 to enumerating the canonically authoritative
councils and synods.[^22]

In addition to textual material strictly defined as canons ("decrees
of pontiffs" and "statutes of councils"), Gratian drew on other
sources which, if not canons according to the narrower technical
definition, could be treated as authoritative in a more general
sense. The most important of these *auctoritates* were drawn from
the writings of major patristic figures such as Ambrose (†397),
Jerome (†419 or 420), Augustine (†430), and Gregory (†604), whom
later generations considered doctors of the church.[^23] It is easy
to see how works such as Ambrose of Milan's *De officiis* ("On
duties") -- a Christian answer to the work of Cicero with the same
title -- could be a rich source of norms. Gratian provides an
explicit list of "the works of the holy fathers that are received
in the Catholic Church."[^24] (It is necessary to distinguish the
papal from the patristic when dealing with figures like Gregory.
While textual excerpts from the letters found in the registers of
Gregory clearly derive their authority from the fact that Gregory
was pope, a text like the *Moralia in Job* has an authority to a
large extent independent of the formal ecclesiastical office Gregory
held.)[^25]

Finally, in addition to excerpts from works of patristic authors,
another source for extra-canonical authorities was secular law,
primarily (pre-Justinianic) Roman law but also including the
capitulary legislation of the more important Carolingian emperors
-- Charlemagne (†814), Louis the Pious (†840), and Charles the Bald
(†877) -- and their successors.[^26]

Up to this point, I have been implicitly referring to Gratian's
material sources, texts such as the *Letters* of Gregory I or the
*de Officiis* of St Ambrose from which the canons in the *Decretum*
were ultimately derived. And in a small number of cases, Gratian
did work directly with material sources. Isidore of Seville's
*Etymologies* is an example of a text from which Gratian probably
collected excerpts directly from the material source. It is also
possible that he collected excerpts directly from Gregory the Great's
*Moralia in Job*. But Gratian drew the overwhelming majority of the
canons he compiled in the *Decretum* from formal sources, predecessor
collections containing patristic, conciliar, and papal (as well as
pseudo-papal) authorities, predigested into canon-sized units of
text.

Peter Landau suggested in 1984 that Gratian had relied primarily
on just five formal sources in writing the Decretum: Anselm of
Lucca's *Collectio canonum*, the pseudo-Ivonian *Collectio Tripartita*,
Ivo of Chartes's *Panormia*, Gregory of San Grisogono's *Polycarpus*,
and an anonymous *Collection in Three Books* (*3L*).[@winroth_making_2000,
15-17] This hypothesis is not universally accepted: Pennington, for
example, believes that Gratian may have relied on one or more
now-lost Central Italian collections similar to the *Collection in
Nine Books* (*9L*).[^28]

By the end of the Patristic period, the canons of the ecumenical
and of historically important provincial councils constituted a
substantial body of canon law, which were gathered into collections
such as the *Collectio Dionysiana* (ca. 500). A later revision of
the *Dionysiana*, the *Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana* (774), exercised
enormous influence on the transmission of canon law to the Carolingian
world and through it to medieval Western Europe.

Collectors like Dionysius Exiguus (†ca. 540), the original compiler
of the *Collectio Dionysiana*, located all authority in the distant
past. This attitude prevailed throughout the period during which
the canonical sources later used by Gratian were being compiled.
Law, however, ultimately has to correspond with and respond to the
needs of contemporary society, and by the ninth century the Church,
especially north of the Alps, was operating in a very different
political and social environment from that of the Mediterranean
world of late antiquity, which had produced the sources for Dionysius's
collection. When faced with the need for new law to cope with new
circumstances, some enterprising Carolingian churchmen took more
recent material -- mostly canons from provincial synods -- and
repackaged them, attributing them to popes from the first century
through Gregory I (†604). The compilers of these collections are
usually referred to as "forgers," a convention I will observe in
the following discussion, but they were not simply inventing their
sources. Most of the material in the collections was genuine but
of relatively recent origin -- the goal of the forgers was simply
to retroject it far enough into the past to make it authoritative.

In order to understand the intent of the forgers, one has to
understand the immediate political situation to which they were
reacting. Charlemagne's son and successor, Emperor Louis the Pious
(†840), was dethroned by three of his sons in a ceremony of public
penance in 833. When Louis was unexpectedly restored less than six
months later, he moved quickly to depose many of the bishops who
had participated in imposing the penance on him, starting with Ebbo,
archbishop of Rheims.[^29] The forgers wanted to protect bishops
from being deprived of office by emperor, king, or metropolitan.
They did this by building up the pope as the only superior who could
judge a bishop. This was convenient, because while popes in the
ninth century had considerable moral authority north of the Alps,
they had little real power. The intent of the forgers' program
therefore was to render bishops effectively impervious to judgment.
The collections that resulted from this effort, the so-called
Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals* and *Benedictus Levita*, were accepted
everywhere as genuine in an age lacking any serious historical-critical
awareness and survived to become important sources for canonical
collectors in the eleventh century.[^30] Many of these forged canons
eventually found their way into Gratian's *Decretum*.

The reform papacy that reached its apogee with the pontificate of
Hildebrand, who reigned as Gregory VII from 1073 to 1085, provided
a new impetus for the collection and study of canons. The special
concerns of the Gregorian reformers also shaped their approach to
the collection and presentation of canons. The consuming interest
of the reform generation was the relationship between *regnum* and
*sacerdotium* (church and state). This interest in the problem of
church-state relations was instrumental: the ultimate concern of
the eleventh-century reformers, as it had been for their eighth-
and ninth-century Carolingian predecessors, was for the reform and
renewal of monastic and clerical life. Unlike the Carolingians,
however, who had thought that cooperation between ecclesiastical
and secular authorities was essential for the reform of religious
life, the eleventh-century reformers believed that secular rulers
had to acknowledge the jurisdictional supremacy of the papacy and
the independence of the church from lay interference as a necessary
precondition for effective clerical and monastic reform. It is
significant that the most important canon law collections of the
reform period were compiled by prelates sympathetic with the reform
movement, such as Anselm, bishop of Lucca (†1086), compiler of the
*Collectio canonum*; Gregory, cardinal of San Grisogono (†1113),
compiler of the *Polycarpus*; and Ivo, bishop of Chartres (†1115),
compiler of the *Panormia*. These collections were compiled by and
reflected the concerns of reform-minded church administrators.
Burchard of Worms (†1025) was a forerunner of this group -- although
he died before the reform papacy or the investiture controversy,
his *Decretum* has more in common with the collections that came
after it than with those that came before it, insofar as it is
systematic and reflects concerns similar to those of his successors.

Unsurprisingly, given their concern with asserting the jurisdictional
supremacy of the papacy and the independence of the church from lay
interference, the eleventh-century collectors showed considerable
interest in the forged decretals of the ninth century. In particular,
252 out of the 315 chapters of the anonymous *Collection in 74
Titles* (ca. 1050) are drawn from the Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals*.[^31]

The program of the Gregorian reformers collided with two practical
realities of eleventh-century life. Abbotts and bishops were large
landowners and therefore important vassals of secular rulers.
Furthermore, secular rulers were almost completely dependent on the
Church for administrative personnel until the rise of university
faculties of Roman law in the twelfth century. It was therefore
essential from the point of view of secular rulers that they should
be able to control appointments to key benefices in order to ensure
the loyalty of their holders. The controversy over this issue
dominated papal-imperial relations for half a century. It was finally
resolved by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which provided that key
benefices were to be filled through regular canonical processes
free from lay interference (such as election by a cathedral chapter)
but that the benefice holder should swear fealty to the secular
ruler for their landholdings.

Gratian depended on a relatively small number of eleventh- and early
twelfth-century systematic canonical collections, his formal sources,
and those predecessor collections, in turn, depended on an older
stratum of mostly chronologically arranged canonical collections.
Gratian was selecting from a body of canonical material that had
already passed through a fairly rigorous filtering process, and two
of the most important filters---the ninth-century pseudo-Isidorian
forgers and the eleventh-century Gregorian reformers---had had an
extremely strong ideological orientation.

## Presentation

Having considered how Gratian sourced and collected his materials---the
question of what canons are and where Gratian got them---we now
turn to the question of how Gratian presented and organized the
canons he had collected. Here, it is important to distinguish between
presentation, the small-grain or micro structure of the *Decretum*,
and organization, the large-grain or macro structure of the *Decretum*.
The organization of the *Decretum* is very regular, so structurally
regular, in fact, that Reuter and Silagi's OCP e-text of the Friedberg
edition can be taken apart using a recursive descent parser,[^32]
and should be thought of as a sequence of hierarchically nested
containers. Taking a bottom-up approach, we will turn first to the
presentation or small-grain structure, and start with the canons,
the atomic containers out of which the higher-order containers in
the *Decretum*---parts, distinctions, cases, and questions---are
built up.

The way in which canons are presented in the *Decretum* differs
somewhat from the way in which they are presented in the predecessor
collections of formal sources from which Gratian selected his
material. The canon package in the formal sources typically included
an inscription, a rubric, and the canon text. Gratian added to the
package a *dictum post canonem* (plural *dicta post canones*)
containing his own commentary on the preceding canon or canons, a
feature borrowed from Alger of Liège's theological treatise *De
misericordia et iustitia*, but without an immediate precedent in
the canonical literature.[^33]

**(The nature of the canon texts proper has been described above
in the section on the collection and selection of canons.)**

A canon is often, though not always, introduced by a rubric. The
name refers to the fact that rubrics were conventionally written
in red ink in manuscripts. A rubric is a very short summary of what
the following canon is about. In many cases the rubric simply reads
"*de eodem*", which means "about the same thing" as the preceding
canon.[^34] **(Pennington and Eichbauer believe that Gratian wrote
the rubrics in the *Decretum* rather than reusing those he found
in formal source collections.[^35] The fact that the rubrics are
short, discontinuous, texts means that they are of effectively no
value for the purpose of authorship attribution. On the other hand,
the fact that they are believed to have been written by Gratian,
and therefore reflect his choice of wording, means that
they are potentially useful evidence in the search for new topics
introduced between the first and second recensions.)**

Most canons have an inscription, which identifies the ultimate
source of authority for that canon, usually a papal decretal, a
canon from an ecumenical council or an important provincial synod,
or a patristic text.[^36] This raises the need to distinguish
Gratian's material sources---an original letter of Pope Gregory I,
for example---from his formal sources---the collection from which
Gratian actually copied his text.[^37] Because Gratian collected
his texts almost exclusively from formal sources, the inscription
was frequently historically inaccurate, especially if the text in
question was one derived from the Pseudo-Isidorian collections.

Finally, there are the *dicta post canones*, usually abbreviated
d.p.c., and literally meaning "something said after the canon". The
*dicta post* are statements that Gratian made on his own authority
as a jurist, carry the thread of his argument, and do his interpretive
work. The *dicta* are texts that Gratian (whether we think of him
as one person or many) actually wrote, and are therefore subject
to analysis for authorship attribution. "The *dicta* in Gratian's
*Decretum* bring the reader closer to its author than any other
part of the text."[@winroth_making_2000, 187] **(The *dicta post*
are not found in Part III, which is in this respect more structurally
similar to the formal source collections Gratian relied on than to
the rest of the *Decretum*)**.

## Organization

The *Decretum* in the form that circulated after around 1150 (the
Köln Dombibliothek manuscripts 127 and 128 are good early examples)
has three parts. The first part consists of 101 distinctions. **The
division into distinctions is traditionally thought to have been
made by Paucapalea (fl. 1140s) rather than by Gratian. The division
seems to have taken some time to reach its final form: Pennington
has pointed out that there were 99-distinction versions of the first
recension, and Rufinus writing in the mid-1160s presumably about
the second recension describes Part I as "having been completed in
on hundred distinctions."** Groups of distinctions form treatises
within the work: the first twenty distinctions, for example, form
a treatise on laws (*tractatus de legibus*) that explores the sources
of law. Other topics covered include ecclesiastical hierarchy and
clerical discipline. The second part consists of 36 cases, which
are further subdivided into 168 questions. Four of the questions,
C.11 q.2, C.17 q.3, C.22 q.3, and C.29 q.1 are empty, and one, C.33
q.3, encapsulates a treatise on penance (*tractatus de penitentia*,
abbreviated *de Pen.*) divided into seven distinctions. The third
part of the *Decretum* is a treatise on sacraments (*tractatus de
consecratione*, abbreviated *de Cons.*) divided into five
distinctions.[@winroth_making_2000, 5] Contemporaries like Rufinus
and Stephen of Tournai understood the parts to treat respectively
of ministries, business, and sacraments: "*primam ministeriis,
secundam negotiis, tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis.*"[^40]

**The *dictum ante canonem* (abbreviated d.a.c.) and *dictum initiale*
(abbreviated d.init.) are special cases of *dicta* and, like the
*dictum post canonem*, were written by Gratian (i.e., the person
performing the author-function at that place in the text). My most
important finding is that the author of the first-recension *dicta*
did not write the case statements. Gratian intended the case
statements to be memorable, not necessarily realistic.**

The hypothetical case statements or *themata* that introduce each
of the thirty-six *causae* (cases) that constitute the second part
of the *Decretum* reflect at least in some places an outlook and a
set of concerns that university-educated urban professionals of the
present day would not find it difficult to identify with. At a time
when considerable attention is being paid in the realm of popular
discourse (if not yet public policy) to the issue of "opportunity
hoarding" on behalf of upper- and upper-middle class children by
their university-educated, urban professional parents, the intense
concern of "a certain man" in the first case statement to secure a
good ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness on more
than one occasion to resort to bribery in order to realize that
objective) has a distinctly contemporary feel to it.[^41]

In other cases, the hypothetical case statements are quite remote
from our own concerns. In case 28, for example, a married infidel,
by which Gratian means a Muslim, converts to Christianity. As a
result, his wife separates from him out of hatred for his new faith.
The convert then takes a new Christian wife, and after she dies,
he is made a priest. Finally, "on account of the merit of his life
and learning," he is elected bishop. Gratian extracts questions
from this fantastical fact-pattern, however, that are of considerable
theoretical, though perhaps not practical, interest: whether there
can be marriage between infidels, whether there is ever a situation
in which a man can take another wife if his previous wife is still
alive; and whether someone who had one wife before he was baptized
and another wife after he was baptized should be considered a
bigamist.

The third part, *de Consecratione*, is problematic in several ways.
That *de Cons.* is a very late addition is not in doubt---it is
absent from all first-recension manuscripts, nor was it included
in the earliest manuscripts of the more widely-circulated
second-recension version of the *Decretum*, as indicated by glosses
found in the Gt, Pf, and Tr manuscripts describing Gratian's work
as "principally divided into two parts."[^42]

[^2]: "Given this lack of reliable extrinsic evidence, our best
source of evidence about Gratian is his book(s)." [@wei_gratian_2016,
33].

[^3]: Manuscripts of Gratian's *Decretum* are frequently referred
to in recent scholarly literature by two-letter abbreviations or
*sigla* derived from their shelfmarks. A reference to Sg (to use a
particularly controversial example) is much more compact and memorable
than one to Sankt Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek 673. Rudolf Weigand
(†1998) generated the original list of *sigla* in the course of his
groundbreaking study of early glossed manuscripts of the *Decretum*,
[-@weigand_glossen_1991]. In the context of Weigand's study early
means before 1216, when Johannes Teutonicus (†1245) finalized the
ordinary gloss, or standardized commentary, on the *Decretum*.
Manuscripts falling outside the original scope of Weigand's
investigation are now assigned *sigla* following the pattern he
set. For example, Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles
acquisitions latines 1761, although an extremely important and early
(possible the earliest) manuscript of the *Decretum*, was not
glossed, and was therefore not assigned a *siglum* by Weigand.
**Verify that Winroth supplied the *siglum* P by which the manuscript
is now commonly identified.** (Although the *sigla* in Weigand's
*Handschriftenliste* adhere consistently to the two-letter convention,
some of the *sigla* supplied by other scholars deviate from it,
e.g., P, Pfr.)

[^6]: **The second order of business is to discuss Winroth's findings
and explain that you will concentrate on what he proposed was the
first recension. I think the explanation for this focus is that the
discovery of the first recension opens up questions about how the
second recension developed. The conjecture that the first recension
had one author—--as Winroth surmises—--and that the second might
have had several is natural. You want to explore the question of
whether the first Gratian was in fact one person. Having done that,
one could then move on to study the nature of Winroth's Gratian 2.\
- Stan Chodorow**

[^7]: "The first recension of the *Decretum* was not a living text.
It was a finished product which its author considered ready to be
circulated. This is evident from its text, which is as much a
finished and polished product as could be expected of any twelfth-century
text. Further, it is also evident from the fact that the first
recension survives in one version only; what differences there are
among the manuscripts are all minor (the apparent exception of Aa
will be discussed below). They are differences one would expect to
find in any manuscript tradition, arising from scribal mistake or
ingenuity. In other words, the manuscripts do not represent different
stages in the development of the text, in the manner of 'classically'
living texts, such as the *Song of Roland*, where each different
manuscript version has an equally valid claim to authenticity."
[@winroth_making_2000, 130].

[^8]: "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore
chosen to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the
author of the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not
intended to suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have
been the same person." [@winroth_making_2000, 122] "It is impossible
to draw any certain conclusions, but the evidence presented in the
last two chapters supports the view that that two recensions had
difference authors." [@winroth_making_2000, 194-195].

[^9]: Excepting only that there is no first-recension version of
Part III.

[^10]: "Compositorem huius operis recte dixerim Gratianum, non
auctorem. Capitula namque a sanctis patribus edita in hoc volumine
composuit, i.e. ordinavit. Non eorum auctor vel conditor fuit, nisi
forte quis eum auctorem idcirco dicere velit, quoniam multa ex parte
sua sanctorum sententias distinguendo et exponendo in paragraphis
suis ponit." [@schulte_summa_1965, 5] "I should properly say that
Gratian is the compiler of this work, not the author, for he brought
together in this volume---that is, he arranged---rulings enacted
by the holy Fathers. He was not their author or framer, unless
perchance someone wishes to say that he is thus the author since
he offered on his own in his dicta many things for clarifying and
explicating the opinions of the holy [Fathers]."

    distinctions in the first part and the last, trans. PLE)

[^11]: Cf. [@larson_master_2014, 12-13, n30] "My refusal to apply
the standard label of 'canonical collection' to the *Decretum* is
meant to make clear that I do not classify the rest of the *Decretum
Gratiani* as a canonical collection in the exact way that the work
of Regino, Burchard, Anselm of Lucca, or even Ivo of Chartres (and
many anonymous compilers) was, and yet it was a canonical collection
in many respects, especially considering much of its source material
and how it was used. Many abbreviations of the *Decretum*, for
instance, are clear testimony that some religious houses and episcopal
courts wanted the canons, not the *dicta*; they wanted a pure
canonical collection that could serve as a reference manual to the
church's law."

[^12]: In earlier collections such as the *Collectio Dionysiana*
(ca.500) the material was organized chronologically.

[^13]: The prologue was prepended (in slightly different forms) to
both the *Decretum* and *Panormia* of Ivo of Chartres. For the
edited Latin text, see [@brasington_ways_2004] For an English
translation, see [@somerville_prefaces_1998, 132-158].

[^14]: Especially in *de Penitentia*.

[^15]: "There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to
be determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three
distinctive parts, with several distinctive sections within the
parts, and these parts have undergone editing as to chapter heading,
chapter insertions, and chapter order. Whatever the later formal
ascription, is Gratian responsible for all these parts? The other
difficulty is the range of roles the one 'responsible' person might
have had -- compiler, commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian
one or all? The difficulties relate to one another, because evidence
that Gratian was, say, the commentator of Part II does not establish
what role he had in Part I." [@noonan_gratian_1979, 162-163].

lead to the conclusion that he used this work directly (as Munier
already argued)." @landau_gratian_2008, 35. "There are six chapters
taken from the *Moralia*, and Gratian noted the book and chapter

[^32]: See Appendix 2 for the Python code listing for my implementation
of the recursive-descent parser. Thanks to Patricio Simari of the
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at The
Catholic University of America, who provided helpful suggestions
on parser implementation. In Computer Science-theoretic terms, the
parsed *Decretum* can be thought of as an ordered tree, with parts,
distinctions, cases, and questions as interior nodes. A canon or
chapter, properly conceptualized as a node encapsulating rubrics,
inscriptions, canon texts, and *dicta post*, is also an internal
node. A *dictum* (*ante*, *post*, or *initiale*) is a terminal node.
So are rubrics, inscriptions, and canon texts. A case statement
(*dictum initiale*) is always the first terminal node of a case. A
*dictum ante* is always the first terminal node of a distinction
or question. A *dictum post* is an optional, and usually the last,
terminal node of a canon. **Example of C.16 q.2 d.a.c.8. The
traditional notation is misleading: d.a.c.1 is not a leaf node of
c.1.**

[^33]: Gratian is known to have used Alger as both a source,
especially in C.1, and, to some extent, as a methodological model.
[@winroth_making_2000, 17, 39, 144]. See Robert Kretzschmar's
edition, [-@kretzschmar_alger_1985]. Somewhat confusingly for Gratian
scholars, Kretzschmar uses regular typeface for Alger's *dicta* and
italics for the canons, the opposite of the convention adopted by
Friedberg **(and Richter before him?)** and continued by Winroth.

[^34]: **The role of the *de eodem* rubrics in Winroth's argument
that the Aa, Bc, Fd, and P mss. of the *Decretum* are a first
recension rather than an abbreviation of the vulgate.
[@winroth_making_2000] Kuttner's statement of the "untidy seams"
problem in "Acta and Agenda", and how Winroth solves it.
[@kuttner_research_1990].** Winroth observed that there are 398 *de
eodem* rubrics in the vulgate *Decretum*, see [@winroth_uncovering_1997,
28]; and [@winroth_making_2000, 127]. The precision of this
frequently-cited number can be refined in ways that demonstrate the
true power of the careful use of electronic resources for the study
of this, or any, text. (In the following examples, ```edF.txt```
is the filename of the OCP-format Reuter and Silagi e-text of the
Friedberg edition. The commands used in the examples should work
on any macOS or Linux-based system.) Winroth's figure of 398 simply
represents the number of occurrences of the substring "de eodem"
in the file: ```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | wc -l``` returns 398.
Most, but not all, of the occurrences of the substring "de eodem"
do, in fact, appear in the context of a rubric, In one case, *de
Cons.* D.2 c.3, the inscription reads *Idem de eodem* ("the same
person about the same thing"), and refining the search to count
those occurrences that do **not** appear alongside the OCP rubric
```<T R>``` or inscription ```<T I>``` tags reveal that in 8
instances, the words *de eodem* are simply part of the text of a
canon or *dictum*: ```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | egrep -v "<T
R>|<T I>" | wc -l``` returns 8. Setting aside, then, those instances
in which the words *de eodem* occur in canons, *dicta*, or inscriptions
(and acknowledging that the criteria for distinguishing between
inscriptions and rubrics can be blurry) leaves 389 rubrics containing
the substring "de eodem": ```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | grep "<T
R>" | wc -l``` returns 389. Of those 389, there are 373 *De eodem*
rubrics and 13 *Item de eodem* rubrics (12 of those 13 introduce
second-recension canons in D.30 in the first part of the *Decretum*):
```fgrep "De eodem." edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l``` returns 373,
and ```fgrep "Item de eodem." edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l```
returns 13. In the three remaining cases, words *de eodem* are part
of a longer rubric: ```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | grep "<T R>" |
fgrep -v "De eodem." | fgrep -v "Item de eodem."``` returns the
rubrics for D.23 c.32 (*De eodem, et ut clerici comam non nutriant*),
C.22 q.5 c. 16 (*De eodem, et ut a ieiunis iuramenta prestentur*),
and *de Cons.* D.1 c.17 (*De eodem, et quod octo diebus dedicationum*).
Winroth's larger point, however, had to do with the place of the
*de eodem* rubrics in the "untidy seams" problem. For that purpose,
only the 137 *de eodem* rubrics in the first recension of the
Decretum are potentially relevant evidence. **See GitHub
[Sand](https://github.com/decretist/Sand/tree/master/rubrics)
repository. This result (137) is potentially off by one, i.e., the
total number of *de eodem* rubrics in the first and second recension
rubric data sets is 388 instead of 389, with no way to tell whether
the missing rubric is from the first or second recension.**

[^35]: **Placeholder for footnote referencing Eichbauer's observation
that Gratian wrote his own rubrics.**

[^36]: The distinction between rubrics and *dicta* is blurry:
"Gratian rarely took his rubrics from earlier collections. Rather
he created his own and often melded the rubrics with the dicta."
[@eichbauer_redactions_2007, 107] "Both J. Rambaud-Buhot and John
Noonan, Jr. have highlighted the similarity between dicta and
rubrics, that is, a rubric very often echoes the dictum that
immediately preceded it." and "These isolated instances in the first
cluster show that Gratian felt that the dictum was sufficient for
summarizing the following *auctoritas*." [@eichbauer_redactions_2007,
115] **Expand to include inscriptions.**

[^37]: "Since Gratian frequently took fragments of letters from the
Register of Gregory I---266 in all---using the inscription 'in
registro', older research assumed that he must have used this
important source in the form of the *Registrum Hadrianum*. According
to more recent research (Landau), even these texts from the Register
of Gregory I found in Gratian derive almost without exception from
canonical collections predating Gratian; the direct use of the
Register is probable in only a single case." [C.27 q.1 c.19 (JE
1496)] [@landau_gratian_2008, 34].

[^40]: Rufinus and Stephen of Tournai describe the tripartite
division in exactly the same words: "librum suum in tribus partibus
distinguit, quarum primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis, tertiam
ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis." [@singer_summa_1963, 5] "he
divides his book into three parts, the first of which he devotes
to ecclesiastical ministries, the second to [ecclesiastical] business,
and the third to ecclesiastical sacraments." [@somerville_prefaces_1998,
192-193] (Rufinus) "Harum primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis,
tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis." [@schulte_summa_1965,
6] "The first of these parts is devoted to ecclesiastical ministries,
the second to ecclesiastical problems, the third to ecclesiastical
sacraments." [@somerville_prefaces_1998, 201] (Stephen of Tournai)
(Brasington translated the preface of Rufinus, Somerville that of
Stephen of Tournai. [@somerville_prefaces_1998, vii]. There is no
indication as to why Somerville chose to translate *negotiis* as
"problems" rather than "business".)

    Given the probable dates of the *summae* of Rufinus (1164) and
    Stephen of Tournai (1165/66), it is just possible that Stephen
    got the wording from the preface to the *Summa* of Rufinus.

    *Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists.*
    Stephen, however, had been a student of Rufinus in Bologna, and
    it seems more likely that this is something he had heard Rufinus
    say in lecture. **Kenneth Pennington, "Étienne of Tournai".**

[^41]: "Quidam habens filium ..." C.1, d.init., edF. 1.357. Although
Gratian does not say so explicitly, I think that we can reasonably
infer that the father is an urban merchant or professional, rather
than a member of the landed aristocracy, since his wealth, the
source of several bribes, is so readily convertible into cash.
