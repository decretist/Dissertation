subtitle: The *Decretum*
---
The *Decretum* represents a towering intellectual achievement of
the renaissance of the twelfth century that ushered in the high
middle ages in Europe. But whose achievement was it? In particular,
is the *Decretum* the achievement of a single author or was it the
product of serial or even collaborative authorship? Because so
little is reliably known about the historical Gratian, and because
almost everything that previous generations thought was known about
Gratian has proved, on closer examination, to be
myth,[@noonan_gratian_1979] it is best to make our first approach
(*accessus*) to the author through his text.[^2] The approach is
made more difficult by the fact that, like many modern university
textbooks, the *Decretum* underwent at least one major revision and
was probably the product of a process of continuous revision.

In 1996, Anders Winroth discovered that four surviving twelfth-century
manuscripts---Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. Soppr.
A. 1.402 (Fd); Barcelona, Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó, Santa Maria
de Ripoll 78 (Bc); Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles
acquisitions latines 1761 (P); and Admont, Stiftsbibliothek 23 and
43 (Aa)---preserve the text of what Winroth called the first recension
of the *Decretum*.[^3] In 1998, Carlos Larrainzar identified Paris,
Bibliothèque Nationale de France, latin 3884 I, fo. 1 (Pfr) as a
one-page fragment of a first-recension manuscript of the
*Decretum*.[@winroth_making_2000, 32] In 2011, Atria Larson discovered
that München, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, lat. 22272 (Mw) contains
an abbreviation of the first recension of the
*Decretum*.[@larson_abbreviatio_2011] The four first-recension
manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P were previously thought to have been
abbreviations and are by one imperfect but frequently-invoked metric
about half the length of the vulgate *Decretum*, 1,860 as opposed
to 3,945 canons.[^6]

Winroth's discovery of the first recension suggests one obvious way
in which it might be problematic to refer simplistically to Gratian
as the author of the *Decretum,* as I have done thus far. Winroth
rejects any presumption of monolithic authorship on stratigraphic
grounds. He argues that the first recension is "coherent and complete"
and that its author intentionally released it into circulation as
a "finished product."[^7] (In other words, it did not just prematurely
escape into the wild like parts of Augustine's *de Trinitate*.)
Winroth thinks of the first and second recensions as distinct textual
layers and argues that two different authors, Gratian 1 and Gratian
2, compiled the two recensions.[^8]

Several decades before Winroth discovered the first recension of
the Decretum and argued that the Gratian of the first recension was
not the same as the Gratian of the second recension, John Noonan
pointed out another obvious way in which it might be problematic
to conceptualize the *Decretum* as the product of monolithic
authorship. As was noted briefly above and will be discussed in
further detail below, the second recension of the *Decretum* had
three distinct parts. Noonan warned that the Gratian of Part I was
not necessarily the same as the Gratian of Part II or Part III.
(And in point of fact, the Gratian of Part III, the compiler of the
treatise on the sacraments *de Consecratione*, is very unlikely to
have been the same as the Gratian of Parts I and II since it was
such a late addition to the *Decretum*.) Furthermore, nothing
logically excludes the possibility that Winroth and Noonan are both
right and that the Gratian of the first-recension of Part I is not
necessarily the same as the Gratian of the second-recension of Part
I, and so on.[^9]

The *Decretum* says nothing about its own authorship. Twelfth-century
readers, however, implicitly endorsed the single-author theory by
subsuming the entire text of the vulgate *Decretum* under the eponym
"Gratian". The *Decretum*, however, like many other scholastic
texts, contains far more quoted than original material. Medieval
opinion was therefore divided not on the question of whether the
*Decretum* had a single author, but rather on the question of whether
the creator of the *Decretum* and creators of similar texts ought
properly to be considered authors at all. Stephen of Tournai in
the preface to his *Summa* on the *Decretum* insists that Gratian
is its compiler, not its author:

> I should properly say that Gratian is the compiler of this work,
not the author, for he brought together in this volume---that is,
he arranged---rulings enacted by the holy Fathers. He was not their
author or framer, unless perchance someone wishes to say that he
is thus the author since he offered on his own in his dicta many
things for clarifying and explicating the opinions of the holy
[Fathers].[^10]

Bonaventure (†1274) indirectly advocates for the opposite opinion in the
preface to his commentary on the *Sentences* of Peter Lombard. He
asks "what is the efficient cause or author of this book?" and
answers that "Peter Lombard, bishop of Paris, is the author of this
book." Bonaventure then notes that "the mode of authorship is
four-fold", and distinguishes the roles of *scriptor*, *compilator*,
*commentator*, and *auctor*, on the basis of the use they make of
"the words of other men" (*aliena*) and their own (*sua*):

> Someone else writes the words of other men and also of his own,
but with his own forming the principal part and those of others
being annexed merely by way of confirmation, and such a person
should be called an author [*auctor*].[^11]

He therefore concludes that:

> Such was the Master [Peter Lombard], who put forward [*ponit*]
his own opinions and confirmed [them] from the opinions of the
Fathers. Whence he truly ought to be called the author of this
book.[^12]

Although Bonaventure's question is stated in the fashionable terms
of thirteenth-century Aristotelian scholastic jargon about causation,
his answer that Peter Lombard can be considered the author of the
*Sentences* can be transferred directly to Gratian and the *Decretum*:
by the logic of Bonaventure's argument, Gratian ought to be considered
the author of the *Decretum*.

Gratian was working within a well-established genre of academic
writing in medieval Latin literature, the canonical collection.[^13]
The *Decretum* followed in the footsteps of any number of systematic
canonical collections that had been in circulation since the beginning
of the eleventh century in which the material was organized by
topic.[^14]

Twelfth-century readers of a canonical collection did not necessarily
expect its compiler to have written all (or even any) of the words
they read. They expected instead to find the distinctive contribution
of the compiler in the selection, editing, and arrangement of texts
not his own: canons of councils, decrees of popes, and extracts
from patristic authorities and secular law, often accompanied by
traditional inscriptions ascribing the texts (accurately or
inaccurately) to recognized authoritative sources. Gratian met this
expectation. Around seventy percent of the text of the vulgate
*Decretum* comes from the tradition of canonical texts accumulated
over the first millennium of the church's history.[^15] An extremely
important part of the authorial activity of Gratian, then, did
consist in the collection and selection of material from the canonical
tradition and in his presentation and organization of the texts
that he had collected and selected.

If the author of a canonical collection had anything to say on his
own authority, he was expected to do so in a prologue. The Prologue
of Ivo of Chartres, for example, was a work of considerable theoretical
sophistication that continued to circulate independently and find
an audience even after Gratian's *Decretum* superseded the collections
to which it had originally been prepended.[^16] Insofar as he did
not provide a preface for the *Decretum*, Gratian failed to meet
this particular expectation of the genre, something that did not
escape the notice of contemporaries like the author of the *Summa
Parisiensis*.[^17]

In presenting and organizing the canonical texts that he had selected,
however, Gratian added a significant amount of first-person commentary
(*dicta*), amounting to around twenty percent of the vulgate
*Decretum*.[^18] Gratian's commentary is what binds the *Decretum*
together into a coherent whole, and his *dicta* form the backbone
of the arguments that he makes. The *dicta* (sayings) are a feature
that Gratian borrowed from another genre, the theological treatise,
specifically Alger of Liège's *De misericordia et iustitia*. In
addition to the *dicta*, Gratian also wrote the rubrics, so-called
because they were written in red ink in manuscripts of the *Decretum*.
The rubrics are one-line summaries of canons that they introduce.

As a first-order approximation, then, Gratian can be considered
the author, in the modern sense of the word, of the *dicta* and
rubrics, and the compiler and arranger of the canons and inscriptions.
(In practice, *dicta*, inscriptions, and rubrics cannot be distinguished
quite so cleanly as we would like: dicta sometimes trail off into
inscriptions, and rubrics and inscriptions are sometimes poorly
separated, especially in *de Penitentia*.) But, as Noonan further
pointed out, the Gratian who compiled, arranged, and edited the
canons and inscriptions was not necessarily the same as the person
who wrote the *dicta*, who in turn was not necessarily the same as
the person who created the rubrics.[^19] All of these considerations
suggest that the presumption that the *Decretum* was the product
of a single author ought to be entertained with extreme caution.
As I turn my attention to the collection and selection, presentation,
and organization of the canonical texts found in the *Decretum*, I
will continue to use the name Gratian as a conventional label for
its author or authors, while withholding judgment as to whether one
person or many stand behind the name.

## Collection and Selection

A canon is an authoritative text that provides a rule or norm for
Christian life, either for individual Christian believers in their
clerical or lay station or for the Church corporately at whatever
level---local church or religious foundation, diocese, province,
or the universal Church. The Greek work *kanon* literally means a
ruler or straightedge used to mark a line, and Christian believers
individually and the Church corporately follow a straight path when
they follow the rules marked out by the *kanones*. "*Canon grece,
latine regula nuncupatur. Regula dicta est eo quod recte ducit, nec
aliquando aliorsum trahit. Alii dixerunt regulam dictam, vel quod
regat, vel normam recte vivendi prebeat, vel quod distortum pravumque
est corrigat.* ('Canon' is Greek for what is called a 'rule' in
Latin. It is called a rule because it leads one aright and never
takes one astray. But others say that it is called a rule because
it rules, presents a norm for right living, or sets aright what is
twisted and bent.)"[^20] The late first- or early second-century
*Didache* is an example of a very early Christian text that contains
such rules or norms. After the official recognition of Christianity
by Constantine in 313, the Church had a greater need for an agreed-upon
set of rules. Such rules were provided by the canons of provincial
and ecumenical councils, and, somewhat later, by papal decretals.

Gratian defines canons as either *decreta Pontificum* ("decrees of
pontiffs") or *statuta conciliorum* ("statutes of councils").[^21]
From a relatively early date, the bishops of Rome had cultivated
the practice of issuing decretal letters, consciously modeled after
Roman imperial rescripts, in which they laid down disciplinary and
doctrinal norms in response to questions put to them, usually by
other bishops.[^22] The earliest surviving example is a letter from
Pope Siricius (†399) to Bishop Himerius of Tarragona, written in
385 in response to a letter that Himerius had sent to Siricius's
predecessor, Pope Damasus (†384).[^23] The letter, sometimes referred
to by the first word of its text as the *Directa* decretal, remains
an important source for norms concerning clerical celibacy in late
antiquity. For modern readers, the most familiar example of an
imperial rescript, the genre after which the papal decretal letter
was modeled, is the early second-century (ca. 112) response of the
emperor Trajan (†117) to a letter from Pliny the Younger inquiring
as to how Pliny, then Roman provincial governor of Bithynia and
Pontus, ought to proceed against those accused of being Christians.

Another extremely important source for the *Decretum* is canons
from the ecumenical councils and from historically important
provincial synods: *Conciliorum vero alia sunt universalia, alia
provincialia*. ("Some councils are universal, others provincial.")[^24]
Although the Council of Nicaea (325) is primarily remembered for
its doctrinal settlement, memorialized in the Nicene Creed, of the
Arian controversy over the divine nature of Christ, it also promulgated
twenty canons of a disciplinary nature. Provincial synods tended
to assume an outsized importance in the canonical tradition when
figures such as Augustine of Hippo (†430) or Caesarius of Arles
(†542) either participated in or presided over them: "*Etiam S.
Augustinus Yponensis episcopus in eadem sinodo legitur fuisse."*
(It is read that St. Augustine, bishop of Hippo, also attended this
synod.)"[^25] By the time the *Decretum* was compiled, the cumulative
output of the ecumenical councils and provincial synods amounted
to a considerable mass of material, and Gratian devoted most of
*Distinctiones* 15 and 16 to enumerating the canonically authoritative
councils and synods.

In addition to textual material strictly defined as canons ("decrees
of pontiffs" and "statutes of councils"), Gratian drew on other
sources which, if not canons according to the narrower technical
definition, could be treated as authoritative in a more general
sense. The most important of these *auctoritates* were drawn from
the writings of major patristic figures such as Ambrose (†397),
Jerome (†419 or 420), Augustine (†430), and Gregory (†604), whom
later generations considered doctors of the church.[^26] It is easy
to see how works such as Ambrose of Milan's *De officiis* ("On
duties")---a Christian answer to the work of Cicero with the same
title---could be a rich source of norms. Gratian provides an explicit
list of "the works of the holy fathers that are received in the
Catholic Church."[^27] (It is necessary to distinguish the papal
from the patristic when dealing with figures like Gregory. While
textual excerpts from the letters found in the registers of Gregory
clearly derive their authority from the fact that Gregory was pope,
a text like the *Moralia in Job* has an authority to a large extent
independent of the formal ecclesiastical office Gregory held.)[^28]

Finally, in addition to excerpts from works of patristic authors,
another source for extra-canonical authorities was secular law,
primarily (pre-Justinianic) Roman law but also including the
capitulary legislation of the more important Carolingian emperors
---Charlemagne (†814), Louis the Pious (†840), and Charles the Bald
(†877)---and their successors.

Up to this point, I have been implicitly referring to Gratian's
material sources, texts such as the *Letters* of Gregory I or the
*de Officiis* of St Ambrose from which the canons in the *Decretum*
were ultimately derived. And in a small number of cases, Gratian
did work directly with material sources. Isidore of Seville's
*Etymologies* is an example of a text from which Gratian probably
collected excerpts directly from the material source. It is also
possible that he collected excerpts directly from Gregory the Great's
*Moralia in Job*. But Gratian drew the overwhelming majority of the
canons he compiled in the *Decretum* from formal sources, predecessor
collections containing patristic, conciliar, and papal (as well as
pseudo-papal) authorities, predigested into canon-sized units of
text.

Peter Landau has suggested that Gratian relied primarily on just
five formal sources in writing the Decretum: Anselm of Lucca's
*Collectio canonum*, the pseudo-Ivonian *Collectio Tripartita*, Ivo
of Chartes's *Panormia*, Gregory of San Grisogono's *Polycarpus*,
and an anonymous *Collection in Three Books* (*3L*).[^29] This
hypothesis is not universally accepted: Pennington, for example,
believes that Gratian may have also relied on one or more now-lost
Central Italian collections similar to the *Collection in Nine
Books* (*9L*).[^30]

By the end of the Patristic period, the canons of the ecumenical
and of historically important provincial councils constituted a
substantial body of canon law, which were gathered into collections
such as the *Collectio Dionysiana* (ca. 500). A later revision of
the *Dionysiana*, the *Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana* (774), exercised
enormous influence on the transmission of canon law to the Carolingian
world and through it to medieval Western Europe.

Collectors like Dionysius Exiguus (†ca. 540), the original compiler
of the *Collectio Dionysiana*, located all authority in the distant
past. This attitude prevailed throughout the period during which
the canonical sources later used by Gratian were being compiled.
Law, however, ultimately has to correspond with and respond to the
needs of contemporary society, and by the ninth century the Church,
especially north of the Alps, was operating in a very different
political and social environment from that of the Mediterranean
world of late antiquity, which had produced the sources for Dionysius's
collection. When faced with the need for new law to cope with new
circumstances, some enterprising Carolingian churchmen took more
recent material---mostly canons from provincial synods---and
repackaged them, attributing them to popes from the first century
through Gregory I (†604). The compilers of these collections are
usually referred to as "forgers," a convention I will observe in
the following discussion, but they were not simply inventing their
sources. Most of the material in the collections was genuine but
of relatively recent origin---the goal of the forgers was simply
to retroject it far enough into the past to meet the standard they
set for authoritativeness.

In order to understand the intent of the forgers, one has to
understand the immediate political situation to which they were
reacting. Charlemagne's son and successor, Emperor Louis the Pious
(†840), was dethroned by three of his sons in a ceremony of public
penance in 833. When Louis was unexpectedly restored less than six
months later, he moved quickly to depose many of the bishops who
had participated in imposing the penance on him, starting with Ebbo,
archbishop of Rheims.[@de_jong_penitential_2009] The forgers wanted
to protect bishops from being deprived of office by emperor, king,
or metropolitan. They did this by building up the pope as the only
superior who could judge a bishop. This was convenient, because
while popes in the ninth century had considerable moral authority
north of the Alps, they had little real power. The intent of the
forgers' program therefore was to render bishops effectively
impervious to judgment. The collections that resulted from this
effort, the so-called Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals* and *Benedictus
Levita*, were accepted everywhere as genuine in an age lacking any
serious historical-critical awareness, and they survived to become
important sources for canonical collectors in the eleventh century.[^32]
Many of these forged canons eventually found their way into Gratian's
*Decretum*.

The reform papacy that reached its apogee with the pontificate of
Hildebrand, who reigned as Gregory VII from 1073 to 1085, provided
a new impetus for the collection and study of canons. The special
concerns of the Gregorian reformers also shaped their approach to
the collection and presentation of canons. The consuming interest
of the reform generation was the relationship between *regnum* and
*sacerdotium* (church and state). This interest in the problem of
church-state relations was instrumental: the ultimate concern of
the eleventh-century reformers, as it had been for their eighth-
and ninth-century Carolingian predecessors, was for the reform and
renewal of monastic and clerical life. Unlike the Carolingians,
however, who had thought that cooperation between ecclesiastical
and secular authorities was essential for the reform of religious
life, the eleventh-century reformers believed that secular rulers
had to acknowledge the jurisdictional supremacy of the papacy and
the independence of the church from lay interference as a necessary
precondition for effective clerical and monastic reform. It is
significant that the most important canon law collections of the
reform period were compiled by prelates sympathetic with the reform
movement, such as Anselm, bishop of Lucca (†1086), compiler of the
*Collectio canonum*; Gregory, cardinal of San Grisogono (†1113),
compiler of the *Polycarpus*; and Ivo, bishop of Chartres (†1115),
compiler of the *Panormia*. Burchard of Worms (†1025) was a forerunner
of this group. Although he died before the reform papacy or the
investiture controversy, his *Decretum* has much in common with
collections compiled during that period, insofar as it is systematic
and reflects concerns similar to those of his successors.

Unsurprisingly, given their concern with asserting the jurisdictional
supremacy of the papacy and the independence of the church from lay
interference, the eleventh-century collectors showed considerable
interest in the forged decretals of the ninth century. For example,
252 of the 315 chapters of the anonymous *Collection in 74 Titles*
(ca. 1050) are drawn from the Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals*.[^33]

The program of the Gregorian reformers collided with two practical
realities of eleventh-century life. Abbots and bishops were large
landowners and therefore important vassals of secular rulers.
Furthermore, secular rulers were almost completely dependent on the
Church for administrative personnel until the rise of university
faculties of Roman law in the twelfth century. It was therefore
essential from the point of view of secular rulers that they should
be able to control appointments to key benefices in order to ensure
the loyalty of their holders. The controversy over this issue
dominated papal-imperial relations for half a century. It was finally
resolved by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which provided that key
benefices were to be filled through regular canonical processes
free from lay interference (such as election by a cathedral chapter)
but that the benefice holder should swear fealty to the secular
ruler for his fiefs.

Gratian depended on a relatively small number of eleventh- and early
twelfth-century systematic canonical collections, his formal sources,
and those predecessor collections, in turn, depended on an older
stratum of mostly chronologically arranged canonical collections.
Gratian was thus selecting from a body of canonical material that
had already passed through a fairly rigorous filtering process, and
two of the most important filters---the ninth-century pseudo-Isidorian
forgers and the eleventh-century Gregorian reformers---had had
extremely strong ideological orientations.

## Presentation

Having considered how Gratian sourced and collected his materials---the
question of what canons are and where Gratian got them---we now
turn to the question of how Gratian presented and organized the
canons he had collected. Here, it is important to distinguish between
presentation, the small-grain or micro structure of the *Decretum*,
and organization, the large-grain or macro structure of the *Decretum*.
The organization of the *Decretum* is very regular, so structurally
regular, in fact, that Reuter and Silagi's Oxford Concordance Program
(OCP) e-text of the Friedberg edition can be taken apart using a
recursive descent parser[^34] and should be thought of as a sequence
of hierarchically nested containers. Taking a bottom-up approach,
we will first consider the presentation or small-grain structure,
and start with chapters (*capitula*), atomic containers out of which
the higher-order containers in the *Decretum*---parts, distinctions,
cases, and questions---are constructed.

Chapters in Parts I and II of the *Decretum* typically consist of
an inscription, a rubric, a canon, and a *dictum post canonem*,
literally meaning "something said after the canon" and usually
abbreviated d.p.c. Some chapters contain multiple canons, each of
which may be accompanied by its own inscription. There are almost
no *dicta post canones* in Part III, which is in this respect much
more similar to the formal source collections Gratian relied on
than to the rest of the *Decretum*.[^35] The discussion that follows
focuses on inscriptions, rubrics, and *dicta post canones*; canons
have been discussed in the preceding section on the collection and
selection, and nothing further needs to be added here.

### Inscriptions

Most canons have an inscription, which identifies the ultimate
source of authority for that canon, usually a papal decretal, a
canon from an ecumenical council or an important provincial synod,
or a patristic text.[^36] Because Gratian collected his texts almost
exclusively from formal sources, rather than material sources like
the register of Pope Gregory I,[^37] the inscription affixed to a
canon was sometimes historically inaccurate, especially if the text
in question was one derived from the Pseudo-Isidorian collections.

### Rubrics

Canons are often, though not always, introduced by a rubric. The
name refers to the fact that rubrics were conventionally written
in red (*ruber*) ink in manuscripts. A rubric is a very short summary
of what the following canon is about. In many cases the rubric
simply reads "*de eodem*", which means "about the same thing" as
the preceding canon. The 137 *de eodem* rubrics introducing
first-recension canons turn out to be important clues into the
development of the text of the *Decretum*.[^38] Stephan Kuttner
observed in 1984 that "in the course its composition the material
outgrew the original plan so that many untidy seams of the texture
remain visible."[@kuttner_research_1990, 13] Canons that are
introduced by *de eodem* rubrics but that are clearly not "about
the same thing" as the preceding canon in the vulgate *Decretum*
are notable instances of visibly "untidy seams." One of Winroth's
strongest arguments that the Aa, Bc, Fd, and P manuscripts represent
a first recension rather than an abbreviation of the *Decretum* is
that otherwise problematic *de eodem* rubrics make sense in the
sequential order in which canons appear in those manuscripts (e.g.,
the *de eodem* rubric for C.24 q.3 c.5 refers back to C.24 q.3 c.2,
which it consecutively follows in the first recension).
[@winroth_making_2000, 15, 70]

Eichbauer and Pennington believe that Gratian wrote the rubrics in
the *Decretum* rather than reusing those he found in formal source
collections.[^41] The rubrics are far too short to be of value for
the purpose of authorship attribution. However, the fact
that they are believed to have been written by Gratian, and therefore
reflect his choice of wording, means that they could potentially
be useful evidence in the search for new topics introduced between
the first and second recensions.

### *Dicta post canones*

Chapters in the formal sources from which Gratian selected his
material typically included an inscription, a rubric, and a canon.
Gratian added a *dictum post canonem* containing his own commentary
on the preceding canon or series of canons, a feature he borrowed
from Alger of Liège's theological treatise *De misericordia et
iustitia* but without immediate precedent in the canonical
literature.[^42] The *dicta post canones* are statements that Gratian
made on his own authority as a jurist. They carry the thread of his
argument and do his interpretive work. The *dicta* are texts that
Gratian (whether we think of him as one person or many) actually
wrote and that are therefore subject to analysis for authorship
attribution. "The *dicta* in Gratian's *Decretum* bring the reader
closer to its author than any other part of the
text."[@winroth_making_2000, 187]

## Organization

We now turn our attention from the chapters, the lower-order
containers that provide the small-grain organization or micro
structure of the *Decretum* to the parts, distinctions, cases and
questions. These higher-order containers, constructed out of chapters,
provide the large-grain organization or macro structure of the
*Decretum*.

### Parts

The *Decretum* in the form that circulated after around 1150 (the
Köln Dombibliothek manuscripts 127 and 128 are good early examples)
has three parts. Contemporaries like Rufinus and Stephen of Tournai
understood the three parts to treat respectively of ministries,
business, and sacraments: "*primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis,
tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis.*"[^44]

The first part was originally written as a collection of treatises
(*tractatus*) but is divided into 101 distinctions in the vulgate
*Decretum*. The division of Part I into distinctions is traditionally
thought to have been made by Paucapalea (fl. 1140s) rather than by
Gratian.[^45] The division seems to have taken some time to reach
its final form: Pennington has pointed out that there were
99-distinction versions of the first recension,[@pennington_biography_2018,
366] and Rufinus writing in the mid-1160s, presumably about the
second recension, describes Part I as "*toto tractatu in centum
distinctionibus exacto* (having been completed in one hundred
distinctions.)"[^47]

Modern scholarship conventionally divides Part I into a treatise
on laws (*tractatus de legibus*) corresponding to distinctions
1-20,[^48] a treatise of those in holy orders (*tractatus ordinandorum*)
corresponding to distinctions 21-80,[^49] and an epilogue to the
*tractatus ordinandorum* corresponding to distinctions 81-101.[^50]
The treatises seem to have started out short and tightly focused
and only later to have coalesced into the larger units: a first-recension
*dictum* in Part II makes reference to a treatise of decretal letters
(*tractatus decretalium epistolarum*) apparently corresponding to
distinctions 19-20 specifically rather than to the *tractatus de
legibus* generally.[^51]

The second part consists of 36 cases, which are further subdivided
into 168 questions. Four of the questions, C.11 q.2, C.17 q.3, C.22
q.3, and C.29 q.1 are empty, meaning that they contain no chapters.[^52]
C.33 q.3, encapsulates a treatise on penance (*de Penitentia*,
abbreviated *de Pen.*) *De Penitentia* is structurally similar to
Part I; it is divided into seven distinctions. Certain sequences
of cases in Part II comprise thematic groups, notably simony (case
1), procedure (cases 2-6), monastic life (cases 16-20), heresy
(cases 23-26), and marriage (cases 27-36).[^53]

The third part of the *Decretum* is a treatise on sacraments (*de
Consecratione*, abbreviated *de Cons.*) divided into five
distinctions.[@winroth_making_2000, 5] That *de Consecratione* is
a very late addition to the *Decretum* is not in doubt---it is
absent from all first-recension manuscripts, and it was not included
in the earliest manuscripts of the more widely-circulated second
recension, as indicated by glosses found in Ghent (Gt), Paris (Pf),
and Trier (Tr) manuscripts describing Gratian's work as "principally
divided into two parts."[^55]

### Distinctions

Parts are internal nodes that contain only other internal nodes
(distinctions and cases). Chapters are internal nodes that contain
only terminal or leaf nodes (inscriptions, rubrics, canons, and
*dicta post canones*). The remaining types of containers, distinctions,
cases, and questions, contain both terminal or leaf nodes (*dicta
ante canones* and *dicta initialia* or *themata*) and internal nodes
(cases contain questions, distinctions and questions contain
chapters).

Distinctions (*distinctiones*) are the highest-order containers in
Part I, *de Pen*., and Part III. They contain a single terminal
node (the *dictum ante*), followed by an ordered sequence of one
or more internal nodes (the chapters) containing inscription, rubric,
canon and *dictum post* terminal nodes.[^56]

### Cases

Cases (*causae*) are the highest-order containers in the second
part of the *Decretum*. Each of the 36 cases in Part II is introduced
by a hypothetical case statement (*thema* or *dictum initiale*,
conventionally abbreviated d.init.). The case statements are a
subset of the *dicta* that are found only in, and that are closely
connected with, the organization of Part II. Medieval and modern scholarship
agree in accepting the *dicta initialia*, like the *dicta ante* and
*dicta post*, as having been written by Gratian.[^57] Cases contain
a single terminal or leaf node (the *dictum initiale*) followed by
an ordered sequence of one or more internal nodes, the questions,
which in turn contain chapters. The depth of Part II, considered
as a tree-structured document composed of hierarchically nested
containers, is one greater than the depth of Parts I and III.[^58]

The case statements all follow a very regular formal pattern. They
are introduced by a hypothetical narrative that is followed by an
enumeration of the questions that Gratian wants to investigate.
The text of C.4 d.init. found in the Admont (Aa), Barcelona (Bc),
and Paris (P) manuscripts of the first recension of the *Decretum*
demonstrates the pattern:[^59]

> Quidam in excommunicatione constitutus episcopum accusare disponit;
adolescentem infra xiiiium etatis sue annum ad assertionem sue cause
adducit. Prohibitus ab accusatione adolescentem accusatorem et se
testem facit. Adolescens personam accusatoris et testis gerere
cupit; die statuta ad iudicium electorum iudicum episcopus minime
concurrit; a communione suspenditur; tandem renouato iudicio accusator
culpabilis in accusatione inuenitur; demum ad assertionem proprie
cause procedit. Hic primum queritur, an in excommunicatione constitutus
alium accusare ualeat? Secundo, an infra xiiiium annum in criminali
causa testari quis possit? Tercio, utrum ab accusatione prohibitus
personam testificantis possit assumere? Quarto, an idem possit esse
accusator et testis? Quinto, an die constituta non occurrens a
communione sit remouendus? Sexto, si in episcoporum iudicio accusatoris
persona culpabilis inuenta fuerit, an ad assertionem proprie cause
de cetero sit admittenda?

> Someone permanently excommunicated (*in excommunicatione constitutus*)
proposes to accuse a bishop; he brings in (*adducit*) an adolescent
under fourteen years of age to support his case; prohibited from
accusation, he makes the adolescent the accuser and himself the
witness; the adolescent wishes to perform (*gerere*) the role
(*personam*) of [both] accuser and witness; on the appointed day,
the bishop does not appear before (*lit.* to) the court of the
selected judges on the appointed day; he is suspended from communion;
at last, after the court reconvened [*lit.* the court having been
renewed], the accuser is found [to be] at fault in [bringing] the
accusation; finally he proceeds to the prosecution of his own case.
Here it is first asked whether someone excommunicated (*in
excommunicatione constitutus*) is able to accuse another? Second,
whether a person (*quis*) under 14 years of age is able to testify
in a criminal case? Third, whether someone prohibited from accusation
is able to assume the role (*personam*) of witness? Fourth, whether
a person is able to be [both] accuser and witness? Fifth, whether
someone who does not appear on the appointed day ought to be removed
from communion. Sixth, if the person of the accuser was found
culpable in the court of the bishops, whether he ought to be admitted
to the assertion of his own case concerning other things? (trans.
PLE)

<!--

C.27 d.init. (chosen for this purpose because it is the shortest
case statement) demonstrates the pattern:

> *Quidam uotum castitatis habens desponsauit sibi uxorem; illa
priori condicioni renuncians, transtulit se ad alium, et nupsit
illi; ille, cui prius desponsata fuerat, repetit eam. Hic primum
queritur, an coniugium possit esse inter uouentes? Secundo, an
liceat, sponsae a sponso recedere, et alii nubere?*[^59] (A man
having [made] a vow of chastity betrothed a wife to himself; she,
renouncing her previous agreement, gave herself to another and
married him; he to whom she had been first betrothed tried to get
her back. Here it is first asked whether there is able to be a
marriage between those vowing? Second, whether someone betrothed
is allowed to abandon the person to whom they are betrothed and to
marry another? [trans. PLE])

[^59]: Friedberg 1.1046.

  -->

The transition between the narrative section and the enumeration
of questions is clearly signalled in each of the case statements
by the use of one of a small number of formulaic markers, of which
*Hic primum queritur* is the most common.[^60]

The case statements appear to have been in some sense lesson plans,
providing the outline for Gratian's classroom presentation of
canonical sources. As such, they were intended to be memorable
rather than realistic.

In D.28, d.init., for example, a married infidel, by which Gratian
means a Muslim, converts to Christianity. As a result, his wife
separates from him out of hatred for his new faith. The convert
then takes a new Christian wife, and, after she dies, he is made a
priest. Finally, "on account of the merit of his life and learning,"
he is elected bishop. Gratian extracts from this fantastical
fact-pattern a series of questions significant from a legal point
of view: whether there can be marriage between infidels, whether
there is ever a situation in which a man can take another wife if
his previous wife is still alive, and whether someone who had one
wife before he was baptized and another wife after he was baptized
should be considered a bigamist.

Some case statements, however, reflect an outlook and a set of
concerns that Gratian's benefice-seeking students probably understood
as realistic, and that university-educated urban professionals of
the present day might not find difficult to identify with. At a
time when considerable attention is being paid in the realm of
popular discourse (if not yet public policy) to the issue of
"opportunity hoarding" on behalf of upper- and upper-middle class
children by their university-educated, urban, professional parents,
the intense concern of "a certain man" in the first case statement
to secure a good ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness
to resort more than once to bribery in order to realize that
objective) has a distinctly contemporary feel to it.[^61]

### Questions

Questions (*quaestiones*) are second-order internal nodes subordinate
to cases and are found only in Part II of the *Decretum*. They are
contained by a case and in turn contain chapters. They are formally
identical with distinctions in Part I, *de Pen*., and Part III---that
is, they contain a single terminal node (the *dictum ante*)
followed by an ordered sequence of one or more internal nodes (the
chapters) containing inscription, rubric, canon and *dictum post*
terminal nodes.

Because questions are contained by and subordinate to cases, the
*dicta ante* that introduce them perform a somewhat different role
in marshalling Gratian's arguments than do those in the distinctions
of Part I, *de Pen*. and Part III. There is no higher level to the
organization of Gratian's arguments in Part I, *de Pen*. and Part
III to which the *dicta ante* in those parts can refer. For each
*dictum ante* in Part II, however, there is a corresponding
item from the list of enumerated question in the *thema* for the
case in which it is contained.[^62] The *dicta ante* restate and
expand upon the questions in the *themata* that present the outline
for the case.

There are 8,547 words in the first-recension *dicta ante* in Part
II. Two first-recension *dicta ante* were modified in the second
recension: 23 words were added to C.21 q.3 d.a.c.1, and 3 words
were added to C.29 q.1 d.a.c.1. In total, only 26 words were added
to the *dicta ante* in the second recension. Thus, the *dicta ante*
in Part II, like the case statements, are quite stable, displaying
very little change between the first and second recension.

<!--

Winroth's appendix *includes*:

C.11 q.2 d.init. (p.212)
C.17 q.3 d.init. (p.216)
C.22 q.3 d.init. (p.218)

Check Admont 43 f.33v to verify that C.17 q.2 d.init. is really
missing. (Bc "breaks off after C.12" [p.26]; P "ends suddenly in
mid-sentence in the middle of C.12, q.2, c.39" [p.32])

C.17 q.2 has no *dictum ante* but is a non-empty question with two
chapters in the first recension. C.17 q.3 has a *dictum ante* but
is an empty question with no chapters in the first recension.

C.17 q.2 does not really have a *dictum ante* in the second recension.
What Reuter and Silagi tagged as <T A> is really an inscription:
"Unde Alexander II.:"

I incorrectly rolled up the following samples with the second-recension
*dicta*. (I was probably confused by Winroth listing them as "d.init."
rather than "d.a.c.1" in his appendix.)

C.11 q.2 d.a.c.1 (42 words)
C.17 q.2 d.a.c.1 (3 words)
C.17 q.3 d.a.c.1 (73 words)
C.22 q.3 d.a.c.1 (58 words)

## Conclusion

**The key finding of the dissertation is that the case statements
were written by someone other than the author(s) of the first-recension
*dicta*.**

[^2]: "Given this lack of reliable extrinsic evidence, our best
source of evidence about Gratian is his book(s)." @wei_gratian_2016
[33].

[^3]: Manuscripts of Gratian's *Decretum* are frequently referred
to in recent scholarly literature by two-letter abbreviations or
*sigla* derived from their shelfmarks. A reference to Sg (to use a
particularly controversial example) is much more compact and memorable
than one to Sankt Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek 673. Rudolf Weigand
(†1998) generated the original list of *sigla* in the course of his
groundbreaking study of early glossed manuscripts of the *Decretum*,
@weigand_glossen_1991. In the context of Weigand's study early means
before 1216, when Johannes Teutonicus (†1245) finalized the ordinary
gloss, or standardized commentary, on the *Decretum*. Manuscripts
falling outside the original scope of Weigand's investigation are
now assigned *sigla* following the pattern he set. For example,
Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles acquisitions
latines 1761, although an extremely important and early (possible
the earliest) manuscript of the *Decretum*, was not glossed, and
was therefore not assigned a *siglum* by Weigand. On the advice of
Weigand, Winroth supplied the *siglum* P by which the manuscript
is now commonly identified: "it was Rudolf Weigand who came up with
it. I had asked him what siglum this ms should have, since I thought
all of the two-letter ones that started with a P had been taken.
He said to use only P, 'because it is such an important manuscript'."
(Anders Winroth email to Paul Evans, October 1, 2018) (Although the
*sigla* in Weigand's *Handschriftenliste* adhere consistently to
the two-letter convention, some of the *sigla* supplied by other
scholars deviate from it, e.g., P, Pfr.)

[^6]: "The second recension contains 3,945 canons (including the
paleae) in the editions. The first recension contains only 1,860
canons (47 percent)." @winroth_making_2000 [122]. The division of
distinctions and questions into canons is a matter of editorial
opinion and therefore unavoidably conventional. The generally-cited
number of 3,945 comes from Friedberg's introduction (edF 1.xii).
Furthermore, many canons include more than one canon text, and the
conventional number obfuscates the distinction between the canon
defined as a container or package and the canon text or texts
included within it. The Reuter and Silagi e-text of the Friedberg
edition has 3,848 canons (identified by the OCP ```<4 N>``` tag,
where N is the canon number) containing 4,394 distinct canon texts
(identified by the OCP ```<T T>``` tag). (Note: ```egrep "<T T>.*<T
T>" edF.txt``` to find the three lines where the canon text tag
occurs twice on the same line.)

[^7]: "The first recension of the *Decretum* was not a living text.
It was a finished product which its author considered ready to be
circulated. This is evident from its text, which is as much a
finished and polished product as could be expected of any twelfth-century
text. Further, it is also evident from the fact that the first
recension survives in one version only; what differences there are
among the manuscripts are all minor (the apparent exception of Aa
will be discussed below). They are differences one would expect to
find in any manuscript tradition, arising from scribal mistake or
ingenuity. In other words, the manuscripts do not represent different
stages in the development of the text, in the manner of 'classically'
living texts, such as the *Song of Roland*, where each different
manuscript version has an equally valid claim to authenticity."
@winroth_making_2000 [130].

[^8]: "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore
chosen to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the
author of the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not
intended to suggest that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have
been the same person." @winroth_making_2000 [122]. "It is impossible
to draw any certain conclusions, but the evidence presented in the
last two chapters supports the view that that two recensions had
difference authors." @winroth_making_2000 [194-195].

[^9]: Excepting only that there is no first-recension version of
Part III.

velit, quoniam multa ex parte sua sanctorum sententias distinguendo
et exponendo in paragraphis suis ponit." @schulte_summa_1965 [5].

of Regino, Burchard, Anselm of Lucca, or even Ivo of Chartres (and
many anonymous compilers) was, and yet it was a canonical collection
in many respects, especially considering much of its source material
and how it was used. Many abbreviations of the *Decretum*, for
instance, are clear testimony that some religious houses and episcopal
courts wanted the canons, not the *dicta*; they wanted a pure
canonical collection that could serve as a reference manual to the
church's law."

1), the title comes from a gloss, not from Gratian.

[^18]: 81,008 words or 19.1%.

[^19]: "There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to
be determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three
distinctive parts, with several distinctive sections within the
parts, and these parts have undergone editing as to chapter heading,
chapter insertions, and chapter order. Whatever the later formal
ascription, is Gratian responsible for all these parts? The other
difficulty is the range of roles the one 'responsible' person might
have had---compiler, commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian
one or all? The difficulties relate to one another, because evidence
that Gratian was, say, the commentator of Part II does not establish
what role he had in Part I." @noonan_gratian_1979 [162-163].

[^34]: See Appendix 2 for the Python 3 code listing for my
implementation of the recursive-descent parser. Thanks to Patricio
Simari of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department
at The Catholic University of America, who suggested this approach
to the problem. In terminology borrowed from the field of informatics,the
parsed *Decretum* can be thought of as an ordered tree, with parts,
distinctions, cases, and questions as interior nodes. A chapter,
properly conceptualized as a node encapsulating rubrics, inscriptions,
canons, and *dicta post canones*, is also an internal node.
(English-language scholarship on Gratian's *Decretum* typically
uses the term *canon* to refer indifferently to both the container
(chapter) and to the text it contains (canon). The following
discussion uses the term *chapter* to refer to the container in
order to reemphasize this important distinction.) Any *dictum*
(*ante* or *post canonem*, or *initiale*) is a terminal node. So
are rubrics, inscriptions, and canons. A case statement (*dictum
initiale*) is always the first terminal node of a case. A *dictum
ante canonem* is always the first terminal node of a distinction
or question. The anomalous C.16 q.2 d.a.c.8 is actually the *dictum
ante canonem* introducing a vestigial fifth question positioned
between C.16 q.2 and C.16 q.3 (see Friedberg 1.787). The traditional
notation misleadingly implies that d.a.c.1 is a leaf node of c.1.
In fact, d.a.c.1 and c.1 are both child nodes at the same nesting
level under one parent distinction or question node. A *dictum post
canonem* is an optional, and usually final, terminal node of a
canon.

[^35]: There are 11 *dicta post* (`<T P>`) tags in Part III (*de
Consecratione*) in the Reuter and Silagi e-text of the Friedberg
edition. Nine are really inscriptions, leaving two short *dicta
post*, *de Cons*. D.1 d.p.c.50 (54 words) and *de Cons*. D.4 d.p.c.20
(19 words). Reuter and Silagi's tagging decisions were in the vast
majority of cases sound, and I made very few changes to them.

[^36]: The distinction between rubrics and *dicta* is blurry:
"Gratian ... often melded the rubrics with the dicta."
@eichbauer_redactions_2007 [107]. "Both J. Rambaud-Buhot and John
Noonan, Jr. have highlighted the similarity between dicta and
rubrics, that is, a rubric very often echoes the dictum that
immediately preceded it." and "These isolated instances in the first
cluster show that Gratian felt that the dictum was sufficient for
summarizing the following *auctoritas*." @eichbauer_redactions_2007
[115].

[^37]: "Since Gratian frequently took fragments of letters from the
Register of Gregory I---266 in all---using the inscription 'in
registro', older research assumed that he must have used this
important source in the form of the *Registrum Hadrianum*. According
to more recent research (Landau), even these texts from the Register
of Gregory I found in Gratian derive almost without exception from
canonical collections predating Gratian; the direct use of the
Register is probable in only a single case." [C.27 q.1 c.19 (JE
1496)] @landau_gratian_2008 [34].

[^38]: Winroth observed that there are 398 *de eodem* rubrics in
the vulgate *Decretum*, see @winroth_uncovering_1997 [28]; and
@winroth_making_2000 [127]. The precision of this frequently-cited
number can be refined in ways that demonstrate the true power of
the careful use of electronic resources for the study of this, or
any, text. (In the following examples, ```edF.txt``` is the filename
of the OCP-format Reuter and Silagi e-text of the Friedberg edition.
The commands used in the examples should work on any macOS or
Linux-based system.) Winroth's figure of 398 simply represents the
number of occurrences of the substring "de eodem" in the file:
```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | wc -l``` returns 398. Most, but not
all, of the occurrences of the substring "de eodem" do, in fact,
appear in the context of a rubric, In one case, *de Cons.* D.2 c.3,
the inscription reads *Idem de eodem* ("the same person about the
same thing"), and refining the search to count those occurrences
that do **not** appear alongside the OCP rubric ```<T R>``` or
inscription ```<T I>``` tags reveal that in 8 instances, the words
*de eodem* are simply part of the text of a canon or *dictum*:
```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | egrep -v "<T R>|<T I>" | wc -l```
returns 8. Setting aside, then, those instances in which the words
*de eodem* occur in canons, *dicta*, or inscriptions (and acknowledging
that the criteria for distinguishing between inscriptions and rubrics
can be blurry) leaves 389 rubrics containing the substring "de
eodem": ```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l```
returns 389. Of those 389, there are 373 *De eodem* rubrics and 13
*Item de eodem* rubrics (12 of those 13 introduce second-recension
canons in D.30 in the first part of the *Decretum*): ```fgrep "De
eodem." edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l``` returns 373, and ```fgrep
"Item de eodem." edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l``` returns 13. In
the three remaining cases, words *de eodem* are part of a longer
rubric: ```grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | fgrep -v "De
eodem." | fgrep -v "Item de eodem."``` returns the rubrics for D.23
c.32 (*De eodem, et ut clerici comam non nutriant*), C.22 q.5 c.
16 (*De eodem, et ut a ieiunis iuramenta prestentur*), and *de
Cons.* D.1 c.17 (*De eodem, et quod octo diebus dedicationum*).
Winroth's larger point, however, had to do with the place of the
*de eodem* rubrics in the "untidy seams" problem. For that purpose,
only the 137 *de eodem* rubrics in the first recension of the
Decretum are potentially relevant evidence. (This result [137] is
potentially off by one, i.e., the total number of *de eodem* rubrics
in the first and second recension rubric data sets is 388 instead
of 389, with no way to tell whether the missing rubric is from the
first or second recension.)

[^41]: "Gratian rarely took his rubrics from earlier collections.
Rather he created his own ..." @eichbauer_redactions_2007 [107].

[^42]: Gratian is known to have used Alger as both a source,
especially in C.1, and, to some extent, as a methodological model.
@winroth_making_2000 [17, 39, 144]. Somewhat confusingly for Gratian
scholars, Robert Kretzschmar's edition of *De misericordia et
iustitia* uses regular typeface for Alger's *dicta* and italics for
the canons, the opposite of the convention adopted by Friedberg and
maintained by Winroth. See @kretzschmar_alger_1985.

[^44]: Rufinus and Stephen of Tournai describe the tripartite
division in exactly the same words. Rufinus: "*librum suum in
tribus partibus distinguit, quarum primam ministeriis, secundam
negotiis, tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat sacramentis.*" @singer_summa_1963 [5]
("[H]e divides his book into three parts, the first of which
he devotes to ecclesiastical ministries, the second to [ecclesiastical]
business, and the third to ecclesiastical sacraments.")
@somerville_prefaces_1998 [192-193]. Stephen of Tournai: "*Harum
primam ministeriis, secundam negotiis, tertiam ecclesiasticis deputat
sacramentis.*" @schulte_summa_1965 [6]. ("The first of these parts
is devoted to ecclesiastical ministries, the second to ecclesiastical
problems, the third to ecclesiastical sacraments.")
@somerville_prefaces_1998 [201]. (Brasington translated the preface
of Rufinus, Somerville that of Stephen of Tournai.
@somerville_prefaces_1998 [vii]. 

    Given the probable dates of the *summae* of Rufinus (1164) and
    Stephen of Tournai (1165/66), it is just possible that Stephen
    got the wording from the preface to the *Summa* of Rufinus.
    Kenneth Pennington,
    [Rufinus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a492)

    *Bio-Bibliographical Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Jurists.*
    Stephen, however, had been a student of Rufinus in Bologna, and
    it seems more likely that this is something he had heard Rufinus
    say in lecture. @pennington_stephen_2019.

[^45]: "In 1933 two scholars, Franz Gillmann and Adam Vetulani,
concluded independently that Gratian himself did not introduce the
division of the Distinctiones into the first part of the Decretum.
They attributed the division to the members of the schools, suggesting
that Paucapalea, the first decretist, may have made it."
@chodorow_ecclesiology_1972, 15. @vetulani_gratien_1990. "Distinctiones
apposuit in prima parte et ultima Paucapalea ..." @mclaughlin_summa_1952
[1]. (Paucapalea arranged the distinctions in the first part and
the last, trans. PLE)

[^47]: @singer_summa_1963 [5]. @somerville_prefaces_1998 [193].

[^48]: Distinctions 1-20 are conventionally referred to by modern
scholars as the treatise on laws (*tractatus de legibus*). I cannot
find an internal reference to it in the *Decretum* under that title.

[^49]: There are three internal references to the *tractatus
ordinandorum* in the vulgate *Decretum*: C.1 q.7 d.p.c.6 "Item:
'Priscis igitur, etc.' Require supra in tractatu ordinandorum."
(first recension, Friedberg 1.430): reference to D.55 c.1 (first
recension, Friedberg 1.215). C.3 q.1 d.p.c.7 "Unde supra in tractatu
ordinandorum: 'Si quis pecunia uel gratia humana, seu populari uel
militari tumultu, etc.'" (second recension, Friedberg 1.507):
reference to D.79 c.9 (first recension, Friedberg 1.278). *de
Cons*. D.1 d.p.c.50 "Item Pelagius: 'Dilectionis tuae rescripta.'
Require in tractatu ordinandorum." (Friedberg 1.1303): reference
to D.76 c.12 (first recension, Friedberg 1.271). Note that this
reference occurs in one of only two substantive *dicta post* in *de
Cons*.

    There is one additional internal reference to this treatise
    under the title *tractatus de promotionibus clericorum*. C.16
    q.1 d.p.c.20 "Gelasius tamen (sicut in tractatu de promotionibus
    clericorum inuenitur) in capitulo illo: 'Monachus nouicius,
    etc.' permittit illos ex dispensatione defensores fieri." (first
    recension, Friedberg 1.766): reference to D.77 c.9 (first
    recension, Friedberg 1.274)

[^50]: Gratian refers at D.81 d.a.c.1 to the section starting at
D.81 as an "epilogue": "*Verum quia aliquantulum diffusius in his
immorati sumus, precedentibus coherentia quedam sub epilogo ad
memoriam subiciamus.*" (Friedberg 1.281) The distinction between
the *tractatus ordinandorum* and the epilogue however is not a
strong one. There are two internal references to the epilogue that
refer to it as if it were simply an undifferentiated part of the
*tractatus ordinandorum*: C.9 q.3 c.15 (inscription) "ut supra in
tractatu ordinandorum, ubi agitur de obedientia minorum erga maiores."
(second recension, Friedberg 1.647): no canon incipit is provided,
but this appears to be a reference to D.93 c.9 (rubric): "Maioribus
minores obedientiam exhibeant." (second recension, Friedberg 1.321).
C.16 q.1 d.p.c.40 "Hoc idem datur intelligi ex uerbis B. Siluestri,
qui obedientiam minorum erga maiores assignans ait: 'Abbas hostiario,
monachus abbati sit subditus,' supra in tractatu ordinandorum."
(second recension, Friedberg 1.773): this also appears to be a
reference to D.93 c.5. (second recension, Friedberg 1.321). C.16
q.1 d.p.c.40 is a first-recension *dictum post* that was expanded
in the second recension. The reference to the second-recension
chapter D.93 c.5 is in the text added to the *dictum* in the second
recension.

[^51]: C.1 q.1 d.p.c.96 "Unde etiam ab ecclesia Romana repudiatur,
et a Deo fuisse percussus legitur in gestis Romanorum Pontificum
hoc modo: 'Anastasius secundus natione Romanus, etc.' Require retro
in tractatu decretalium epistolarum." (first recension, Friedberg
1.392) refers to D.19 c.9 (first recension, Friedberg 1.63). Use
of the title "treatise of decretal letters" strongly suggests that
this is to be read as a specific reference to a self-contained text
corresponding to distinctions 19-20 rather than to the treatise on
laws generally.

[^52]: All of the empty questions contain a *dictum ante* (see
below) in the vulgate *Decretum*, but in three of the four cases
it was added only in the second recension: C.11 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17
q.3 d.a.c.1, and C.22 q.3 d.a.c.1.

[^53]: The cases can be grouped thematically: simony (C.1), procedure
(CC.2-6), other (CC.7-10), other (CC.11-15), monastic (CC.16-20),
other (CC.21-22), heresy (CC.23-26), and marriage (CC.27-36). The
thematic groupings are to some extent a matter of opinion. Anders
Winroth referred me to Alfred Beyer's groupings which I have found
useful. @beyer_lokale_1998 [17].

[^55]: Three early manuscripts (Gt, Pf, and Tr) contain the gloss:
"*Concordia discordantium canonum iuxta determinationem Gratiani
episcopi quae in duas partes principaliter est divisa* (The reconciliation
of contradictory canons according to the determination of Bishop
Gratian, which is principally divided into two parts.)" Gt = Ghent,
Bibl. der Rijksuniversiteit 55; Pf = Paris, Bibl. Nationale lat.
3884 I and II; and Tr = Trier, Stadtbibl. 906 (1141). See
@noonan_gratian_1979 [154]; and @pennington_biography_2018 [382].

[^56]: Add footnote restating distinction between canon and chapter.

[^57]: I continue here, as I have throughout Chapter 2, to use the
name Gratian as a conventional label for the author or authors of
the *Decretum*, while deferring judgement as to whether the name
stands for a single individual or many. Anticipating Chapter 3, the
name Gratian can be taken to stand for someone performing the
author-function (Foucault) with respect to a discrete selection of
text under consideration (e.g., a particular *dictum*).

[^58]: In Parts I and II, the part contains distinctions which
contain chapters (depth = 3). In Part II, the part contains cases
which contain questions which contain chapters (depth = 4).

[^59]: Edited by Paul Evans based on transcriptions by University
of San Diego students Emily Bolender (P) and Paige Ferguson (Aa and
Bc).

[^60]: The formulaic transition markers used in the hypothetical
case statements are: *Hic primum queritur* (15), *Queritur* (8),
*Modo primum queritur* (3), *Nunc primum queritur* (3), *Primo
queritur* (2), *Primum queritur* (2), *Hic primo queritur* (1),
*Modo queritur* (1), *Queritur autem* (1).

[^61]: C.1 d.init., Friedberg 1.357. Although Gratian does not say
so explicitly, I think that we can reasonably infer that the father
is an urban merchant or professional, rather than a member of the
landed aristocracy, since his wealth is in a form sufficiently
liquid to be readily convertible into cash bribes.

[^62]: In terms borrowed from informatics, the distinction is between
tree-structured data in which internal nodes have only sibling
pointers, and tree-structured data in which internal nodes have
both sibling and parent pointers.
