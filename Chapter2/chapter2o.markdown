## Organization

### Cases and Questions

**\[Move all discussion of d.a.c. and d.init. into Organization. Case
statements or *themata* are a special case of *dicta* found only in, and
closely tied to the organization of, Part II.\]**

**The *dictum ante canonem* (abbreviated d.a.c.) and *dictum initiale*
(abbreviated d.init.) are special cases of *dicta* and, like the *dictum
post canonem*, were written by Gratian (i.e., the person performing the
author-function at that place in the text). My most important finding is
that the author of the first-recension *dicta* did not write the case
statements. Gratian intended the case statements to be memorable, not
necessarily realistic.**

The key finding of the dissertation is that the case statements were
written by someone other than the author(s) of the first-recension
*dicta*. The emphasis of the discussion of *dicta ante* will therefore
necessarily be on their function in the organization of Part II. The
questions in Part II are formally coordinate with the distinctions in
Part I, *de Pen*. and Part III.

There are 8,371 words in the first-recension *dicta ante* in Part II.
Four *dicta ante* (C.11 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.3 d.a.c.1,
and C.22 q.3 d.a.c.1) were added in their entirety to the second
recension, presumably because the questions they introduced were not
added to the *Decretum* until the second recension.[1] Two
first-recension *dicta ante* were modified in the second recension: 23
words were added to C.21 q.3 d.a.c.1, and 3 words were added to C.29 q.1
d.a.c.1.In total, only 202 words were added to the *dicta ante* in the
second recension. Thus, the *dicta ante* in Part II, like the case
statements, are quite stable, displaying very little change between the
first and second recension.

The case statements all follow a very regular formal pattern. They are
introduced by a hypothetical narrative that is followed by an
enumeration of the questions that Gratian wants to investigate. C.27
d.init. (chosen for this purpose because it is the shortest case
statement) demonstrates the pattern:

> *Quidam uotum castitatis habens desponsauit sibi uxorem; illa priori
> condicioni renuncians, transtulit se ad alium, et nupsit illi; ille,
> cui prius desponsata fuerat, repetit eam. Hic primum queritur, an
> coniugium possit esse inter uouentes? Secundo, an liceat, sponsae a
> sponso recedere, et alii nubere?*[2]

The transition between the narrative section and the enumeration of
questions is clearly signalled in each of the case statements by the use
of one of a small number of formulaic markers, of which *Hic primum
queritur* is the most common.[3]

The hypothetical case statements or *themata* that introduce each of the
thirty-six *causae* (cases) that constitute the second part of the
*Decretum* reflect at least in some places an outlook and a set of
concerns that university-educated urban professionals of the present day
would not find it difficult to identify with. At a time when
considerable attention is being paid in the realm of popular discourse
(if not yet public policy) to the issue of "opportunity hoarding" on
behalf of upper- and upper-middle class children by their
university-educated, urban professional parents, the intense concern of
"a certain man" in the first case statement to secure a good
ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness on more than one
occasion to resort to bribery in order to realize that objective) has a
distinctly contemporary feel to it.[4]

In other cases, the hypothetical case statements are quite remote from
our own concerns. In case 28, for example, a married infidel, by which
Gratian means a Muslim, converts to Christianity. As a result, his wife
separates from him out of hatred for his new faith. The convert then
takes a new Christian wife, and after she dies, he is made a priest.
Finally, "on account of the merit of his life and learning," he is
elected bishop. Gratian extracts questions from this fantastical
fact-pattern, however, that are of considerable theoretical, though
perhaps not practical, interest: whether there can be marriage between
infidels, whether there is ever a situation in which a man can take
another wife if his previous wife is still alive; and whether someone
who had one wife before he was baptized and another wife after he was
baptized should be considered a bigamist.

[1] **Confirm**. If these questions are missing altogether in the first
recension, what is the relationship to the questions as stated in the
initial case statement?

[2] A man having \[made\] a vow of chastity betrothed a wife to himself;
she, renouncing her previous agreement, gave herself to another and
married him; he to whom she had been first betrothed tried to get her
back. Here it is first asked whether there is able to be a marriage
between those vowing? Second, whether someone betrothed is allowed to
abandon the person to whom they are betrothed and to marry another?

[3] The formulaic transition markers used in the hypothetical case
statements are: *Hic primum queritur* (15), *Queritur* (8), *Modo primum
queritur* (3), *Nunc primum queritur* (3), *Primo queritur* (2), *Primum
queritur* (2), *Hic primo queritur* (1), *Modo queritur* (1), *Queritur
autem* (1).

[4] "Quidam habens filium ..." C.1, d.init., Friedberg 1.357. Although
Gratian does not say so explicitly, I think that we can reasonably infer
that the father is an urban merchant or professional, rather than a
member of the landed aristocracy, since his wealth, the source of
several bribes, is so readily convertible into cash.
