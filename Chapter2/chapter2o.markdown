## Organization

### Cases

Cases (*causae*) are the highest-order containers in the second part of
the *Decretum*. Each of the 36 cases in Part II is introduced by a
hypothetical case statement (*thema* or *dictum initiale*,
conventionally abbreviated d.init.). The case statements are a subset of
the *dicta* that are found only in, and that are closely tied to the
organization of, Part II. Medieval and modern scholarship agree in
accepting the *dicta initialia*, like the *dicta ante* and *dicta post*,
as having been written by Gratian.[1] Cases contain a single terminal or
leaf node (the *dictum initiale*) followed by an ordered sequence of one
or more internal nodes, the questions, which in turn contain chapters.
The depth of Part II, considered as a tree-structured document composed
of nested containers, is one greater than the depth of Parts I and
III.[2]

The case statements all follow a very regular formal pattern. They are
introduced by a hypothetical narrative that is followed by an
enumeration of the questions that Gratian wants to investigate. C.27
d.init. (chosen for this purpose because it is the shortest case
statement) demonstrates the pattern:

> *Quidam uotum castitatis habens desponsauit sibi uxorem; illa priori
> condicioni renuncians, transtulit se ad alium, et nupsit illi; ille,
> cui prius desponsata fuerat, repetit eam. Hic primum queritur, an
> coniugium possit esse inter uouentes? Secundo, an liceat, sponsae a
> sponso recedere, et alii nubere?*[3] (A man having \[made\] a vow of
> chastity betrothed a wife to himself; she, renouncing her previous
> agreement, gave herself to another and married him; he to whom she had
> been first betrothed tried to get her back. Here it is first asked
> whether there is able to be a marriage between those vowing? Second,
> whether someone betrothed is allowed to abandon the person to whom
> they are betrothed and to marry another? \[trans. PLE\])

The transition between the narrative section and the enumeration of
questions is clearly signalled in each of the case statements by the use
of one of a small number of formulaic markers, of which *Hic primum
queritur* is the most common.[4]

The cases statements appear to have been in some sense lesson plans,
providing the outline for Gratian's classroom presentation of canonical
sources. As such, they were intended to be memorable rather than
realistic.

In D.28, d.init., for example, a married infidel, by which Gratian means
a Muslim, converts to Christianity. As a result, his wife separates from
him out of hatred for his new faith. The convert then takes a new
Christian wife, and after she dies, he is made a priest. Finally, "on
account of the merit of his life and learning," he is elected bishop.
Gratian extracts from this fantastical fact-pattern a series of
questions significant from a legal point of view: whether there can be
marriage between infidels, whether there is ever a situation in which a
man can take another wife if his previous wife is still alive, and
whether someone who had one wife before he was baptized and another wife
after he was baptized should be considered a bigamist.

Some case statements, however, reflect an outlook and a set of concerns
that Gratian's benefice-seeking students probably understood as
realistic, and that university-educated urban professionals of the
present day might not find difficult to identify with. At a time when
considerable attention is being paid in the realm of popular discourse
(if not yet public policy) to the issue of "opportunity hoarding" on
behalf of upper- and upper-middle class children by their
university-educated, urban professional parents, the intense concern of
"a certain man" in the first case statement to secure a good
ecclesiastical career for his son (and his willingness to resort more
than once to bribery in order to realize that objective) has a
distinctly contemporary feel to it.[5]

**The key finding of the dissertation is that the case statements were
written by someone other than the author(s) of the first-recension
*dicta*.**

### Questions

The *dictum ante canonem* (abbreviated d.a.c.) and *dictum initiale*
(abbreviated d.init.) are special cases of *dicta* and, like the *dictum
post canonem*, were written by Gratian (i.e., the person performing the
author-function at that place in the text).

The emphasis of the discussion of *dicta ante* will necessarily be on
their function in the organization of Part II. The questions in Part II
are formally coordinate with the distinctions in Part I, *de Pen*. and
Part III.

There are 8,371 words in the first-recension *dicta ante* in Part II.
Four *dicta ante* (C.11 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.3 d.a.c.1,
and C.22 q.3 d.a.c.1) were added in their entirety to the second
recension, presumably because the questions they introduced were not
added to the *Decretum* until the second recension.[6] Two
first-recension *dicta ante* were modified in the second recension: 23
words were added to C.21 q.3 d.a.c.1, and 3 words were added to C.29 q.1
d.a.c.1.In total, only 202 words were added to the *dicta ante* in the
second recension. Thus, the *dicta ante* in Part II, like the case
statements, are quite stable, displaying very little change between the
first and second recension.

[1] I continue here, as I have throughout Chapter 2, to use the name
Gratian as a conventional label for the author or authors of the
*Decretum*, while deferring judgement as to whether the name stands for
a single individual or many. Anticipating Chapter 3, the name Gratian
can be taken to stand for someone performing the author-function
(Foucault) with respect to a discrete selection of text under
consideration (e.g., a particular *dictum*).

[2] In Parts I and II, the part contains distinctions which contain
chapters (depth = 3). In Part II, the part contains cases which contain
questions which contain chapters (depth = 4).

[3] Friedberg, 1.1046.

[4] The formulaic transition markers used in the hypothetical case
statements are: *Hic primum queritur* (15), *Queritur* (8), *Modo primum
queritur* (3), *Nunc primum queritur* (3), *Primo queritur* (2), *Primum
queritur* (2), *Hic primo queritur* (1), *Modo queritur* (1), *Queritur
autem* (1).

[5] C.1 d.init., Friedberg 1.357. Although Gratian does not say so
explicitly, I think that we can reasonably infer that the father is an
urban merchant or professional, rather than a member of the landed
aristocracy, since his wealth is in a form sufficiently liquid to be
readily convertible into cash bribes.

[6] **Confirm**. If these questions are missing altogether in the first
recension, what is the relationship to the questions as stated in the
initial case statement?
