## Organization

### Questions

Questions are second-order internal nodes subordinate to cases, and are
found only in Part II of the *Decretum*. They are contained by a case
and in turn contain chapters. They are formally identical with
distinctions in Part I, *de Pen*., and Part III, that is, they contain a
single terminal node (the *dictum ante*), followed by an ordered
sequence of one or more internal nodes (the chapters) containing
inscription, rubric, canon and *dictum post* terminal nodes.

Because questions are contained by and subordinate to cases, the *dicta
ante* that introduce them perform a somewhat different role in
marshalling Gratian's arguments than do those in the distinctions of
Part I, *de Pen*. and Part III. There is no higher level to the
organization of Gratian's arguments in Part I, *de Pen*. and Part III to
which the *dicta ante* in those parts can refer. For each *dictum ante*
in Part II, on the other hand, there is a corresponding item from the
list of enumerated question in the *thema* for the case in which it is
contained.[1]

There are 8,371 words in the first-recension *dicta ante* in Part II.
Four *dicta ante* (C.11 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.2 d.a.c.1, C.17 q.3 d.a.c.1,
and C.22 q.3 d.a.c.1) were added in their entirety to the second
recension, presumably because the questions they introduced were not
added to the *Decretum* until the second recension.[2] Two
first-recension *dicta ante* were modified in the second recension: 23
words were added to C.21 q.3 d.a.c.1, and 3 words were added to C.29 q.1
d.a.c.1.In total, only 202 words were added to the *dicta ante* in the
second recension. Thus, the *dicta ante* in Part II, like the case
statements, are quite stable, displaying very little change between the
first and second recension.

[1] In terms borrowed from informatics, the distinction is between
tree-structured data in which internal nodes have only sibling pointers,
and tree-structured data in which internal nodes have both sibling and
parent pointers.

[2] **Confirm**. If these questions are missing altogether in the first
recension, what is the relationship to the questions as stated in the
initial case statement?
