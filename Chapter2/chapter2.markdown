The *Decretum* represents a towering intellectual achievement of the
renaissance of the twelfth century that ushered in the high middle ages
in Europe. But whose achievement was it? In particular, is the
*Decretum* the achievement of a single author or was it the product of
serial or even collaborative authorship? Because so little is reliably
known about the historical Gratian, and because almost everything that
previous generations thought was known about Gratian has proved, on
closer examination, to be myth,[1] it is best to make our first approach
(*accessus*) to the author through his text.[2] The approach is made
more difficult by the fact that, like many modern university textbooks,
the *Decretum* underwent at least one major revision and was probably
the product of a process of continuous revision.

In 1996, Anders Winroth discovered that four surviving twelfth-century
manuscripts---Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. Soppr. A.
1.402 (Fd); Barcelona, Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó, Santa Maria de Ripoll
78 (Bc); Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles acquisitions
latines 1761 (P); and Admont, Stiftsbibliothek 23 and 43 (Aa)---preserve
the text of what Winroth called the first recension of the
*Decretum*.[3] In 1998, Carlos Larrainzar identified Paris, Bibliothèque
Nationale de France, latin 3884 I, fo. 1 (Pfr) as a one-page fragment of
a first-recension manuscript of the *Decretum*.[4] In 2011, Atria Larson
discovered that München, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, lat. 22272 (Mw)
contains an abbreviation of the first recension of the *Decretum*.[5]
The four first-recension manuscripts Aa, Bc, Fd, and P were previously
thought to have been abbreviations and are by one imperfect but
frequently-invoked metric about half the length of the vulgate
*Decretum*, 1,860 as opposed to 3,945 canons.[6]

Winroth's discovery of the first recension suggests one obvious way in
which it might be problematic to refer simplistically to Gratian as the
author of the *Decretum,* as I have done thus far. Winroth rejects any
presumption of monolithic authorship on stratigraphic grounds. He argues
that the first recension is "coherent and complete" and that its author
intentionally released it into circulation as a "finished product."[7]
(In other words, it did not just prematurely escape into the wild like
parts of Augustine's *de Trinitate*.) Winroth thinks of the first and
second recensions as distinct textual layers and argues that two
different authors, Gratian 1 and Gratian 2, compiled the two
recensions.[8]

Several decades before Winroth discovered the first recension of the
Decretum and argued that the Gratian of the first recension was not the
same as the Gratian of the second recension, John Noonan pointed out
another obvious way in which it might be problematic to conceptualize
the *Decretum* as the product of monolithic authorship. As was noted
briefly above and will be discussed in further detail below, the second
recension of the *Decretum* had three distinct parts. Noonan warned that
the Gratian of Part I was not necessarily the same as the Gratian of
Part II or Part III. (And in point of fact, the Gratian of Part III, the
compiler of the treatise on the sacraments *de Consecratione*, is very
unlikely to have been the same as the Gratian of Parts I and II since it
was such a late addition to the *Decretum*.) Furthermore, nothing
logically excludes the possibility that Winroth and Noonan are both
right and that the Gratian of the first-recension of Part I is not
necessarily the same as the Gratian of the second-recension of Part I,
and so on.[9]

The *Decretum* says nothing about its own authorship. Twelfth-century
readers, however, implicitly endorsed the single-author theory by
subsuming the entire text of the vulgate *Decretum* under the eponym
"Gratian", even through they recognized that he was not directly
responsible for certain notable formal features of the work, such as the
division of Part I into *distinctiones*.[10]

Furthermore, the *Decretum*, like many other scholastic texts, contains
far more quoted than original material. Medieval opinion was
consequently divided on the question of whether the creators of the
*Decretum* and similar texts ought properly to be considered their
authors. Stephen of Tournai in the preface to his *Summa* on the
*Decretum* insists that Gratian is its compiler, not its author:

> I should properly say that Gratian is the compiler of this work, not
> the author, for he brought together in this volume---that is, he
> arranged---rulings enacted by the holy Fathers. He was not their
> author or framer, unless perchance someone wishes to say that he is
> thus the author since he offered on his own in his dicta many things
> for clarifying and explicating the opinions of the holy
> \[Fathers\].[11]

Bonaventure (†1274) indirectly advocates for the opposite opinion in the
preface to his commentary on the *Sentences* of Peter Lombard. He asks
"what is the efficient cause or author of this book?", and answers that
"Peter Lombard, bishop of Paris, is the author of this book."
Bonaventure then notes that "the mode of authorship is four-fold", and
distinguishes the roles of *scriptor*, *compilator*, *commentator*, and
*auctor*, on the basis of the use they make of "the words of other men"
(*aliena*) and their own (*sua*):

> Someone else writes the words of other men and also of his own, but
> with his own forming the principle part and those of others being
> annexed merely by way of confirmation, and such a person should be
> called an author \[*auctor*\].[12]

He therefore concludes that:

> Such was the Master \[Peter Lombard\], who put forward \[*ponit*\] his
> own opinions, and confirmed \[them\] from the opinions of the Fathers.
> Whence he truly ought to be called the author of this book.[13]

Although Bonaventure's question is stated in the fashionable terms of
thirteenth-century Aristotelian scholastic jargon about causation, his
answer that Peter Lombard can be considered the author of the
*Sentences* can be transferred directly to Gratian and the *Decretum*:
by the logic of Bonaventure's argument, Gratian ought to be considered
the author of the *Decretum*.

Gratian was working within a well-established genre of academic writing
in medieval Latin literature, the canonical collection.[14] The
*Decretum* followed in the footsteps of any number of systematic
canonical collections that had been in circulation since the beginning
of the eleventh century in which the material was organized by
topic.[15]

Twelfth-century readers of a canonical collection did not necessarily
expect its compiler to have written all (or even any) of the words they
read. They expected instead to find the distinctive contribution of the
compiler in the selection, editing, and arrangement of texts not his
own: canons of councils, decrees of popes, and extracts from patristic
authorities and secular law, often accompanied by traditional
inscriptions ascribing the texts (accurately or inaccurately) to
recognized authoritative sources. Gratian met this expectation. Around
seventy percent of the text of the vulgate *Decretum* comes from the
tradition of canonical texts accumulated over the first millennium of
the church's history.[16] An extremely important part of the authorial
activity of Gratian, then, did consist in the collection and selection
of material from the canonical tradition and in his presentation and
organization of the texts that he had collected and selected.

If the author of a canonical collection had anything to say on his own
authority, he was expected to do so in a prologue. The Prologue of Ivo
of Chartres, for example, was a work of considerable theoretical
sophistication that continued to circulate independently and find an
audience even after Gratian's *Decretum* superseded the collections to
which it had originally been prepended.[17] Insofar as he did not
provide a preface for the *Decretum*, Gratian failed to meet this
particular expectation of the genre, something that did not escape the
notice of contemporaries like the author of the *Summa Parisiensis*.[18]

In presenting and organizing the canonical texts that he had selected,
however, Gratian added a significant amount of first-person commentary
(*dicta*), amounting to around twenty percent of the vulgate
*Decretum*.[19] Gratian's commentary is what binds the *Decretum*
together into a coherent whole, and his *dicta* form the backbone of the
arguments that he makes. The *dicta* (sayings) are a feature that
Gratian borrowed from another genre, the theological treatise,
specifically Alger of Liège's *De misericordia et iustitia*. In addition
to the *dicta*, Gratian also wrote the rubrics, so-called because they
were written in red ink in manuscripts of the *Decretum*. The rubrics
are one-line summaries of canons that they introduce.

As a first-order approximation, then, Gratian can be considered the
author, in the modern sense of the word, of the *dicta* and rubrics, and
the compiler and arranger of the canons and inscriptions. (In practice,
*dicta*, inscriptions, and rubrics cannot be distinguished quite so
cleanly as we would like: dicta sometimes trail off into inscriptions,
and rubrics and inscriptions are sometimes poorly separated, especially
in *de Penitentia*.) But, as Noonan further pointed out, the Gratian who
compiled, arranged, and edited the canons and inscriptions was not
necessarily the same as the person who wrote the *dicta*, who in turn
was not necessarily the same as the person who created the rubrics.[20]
All of these considerations suggest that the presumption that the
*Decretum* was the product of a single author ought to be entertained
with extreme caution. As I turn my attention to the collection and
selection, presentation, and organization of the canonical texts found
in the *Decretum*, I will continue to use the name Gratian as a
conventional label for its author or authors, while withholding judgment
as to whether one person or many stand behind the name

## Collection and Selection

A canon is an authoritative text that provides a rule or norm for
Christian life, either for individual Christian believers in their
clerical or lay station or for the Church corporately at whatever
level---local church or religious foundation, diocese, province, or the
universal Church. The Greek work *kanon* literally means a ruler or
straightedge used to mark a line, and Christian believers individually
and the Church corporately follow a straight path when they follow the
rules marked out by the *kanones*. "*Canon grece, latine regula
nuncupatur. Regula dicta est eo quod recte ducit, nec aliquando aliorsum
trahit. Alii dixerunt regulam dictam, vel quod regat, vel normam recte
vivendi prebeat, vel quod distortum pravumque est corrigat.* ('Canon' is
Greek for what is called a 'rule' in Latin. It is called a rule because
it leads one aright and never takes one astray. But others say that it
is called a rule because it rules, presents a norm for right living, or
sets aright what is twisted and bent.)"[21] The late first- or early
second-century *Didache* is an example of a very early Christian text
that contains such rules or norms. After the official recognition of
Christianity by Constantine in 313, the Church had a greater need for an
agreed-upon set of rules. Such rules were provided by the canons of
provincial and ecumenical councils, and somewhat later by papal
decretals.

Gratian defines canons as either *decreta Pontificum* ("decrees of
pontiffs") or *statuta conciliorum* ("statutes of councils").[22] From a
relatively early date, the bishops of Rome had cultivated the practice
of issuing decretal letters, consciously modeled after Roman imperial
rescripts, in which they laid down disciplinary and doctrinal norms in
response to questions put to them, usually by other bishops.[23] The
earliest surviving example is a letter from Pope Siricius (†399) to
Bishop Himerius of Tarragona, written in 385 in response to a letter
that Himerius had sent to Siricius's predecessor, Pope Damasus
(†384).[24] The letter, sometimes referred to by the first word of its
text as the *Directa* decretal, remains an important source for norms
concerning clerical celibacy in late antiquity. For modern readers, the
most familiar example of an imperial rescript, the genre after which the
papal decretal letter was modeled, is the early second-century (ca. 112)
response of the emperor Trajan (†117) to a letter from Pliny the Younger
inquiring as to how Pliny, then Roman provincial governor of Bithynia
and Pontus, ought to proceed against those accused of being Christians.

Another extremely important source for the *Decretum* is canons from the
ecumenical councils and from historically important provincial synods:
*Conciliorum vero alia sunt universalia, alia provincialia*. ("Some
councils are universal, others provincial.")[25] Although the Council of
Nicaea (325) is primarily remembered for its doctrinal settlement,
memorialized in the Nicene Creed, of the Arian controversy over the
divine nature of Christ, it also promulgated twenty canons of a
disciplinary nature. Provincial synods tended to assume an outsized
importance in the canonical tradition when figures such as Augustine of
Hippo (†430) or Caesarius of Arles (†542) either participated in or
presided over them: "*Etiam S. Augustinus Yponensis episcopus in eadem
sinodo legitur fuisse."* (It is read that St. Augustine, bishop of
Hippo, also attended this synod.)"[26] By the time the *Decretum* was
compiled, the cumulative output of the ecumenical councils and
provincial synods amounted to a considerable mass of material, and
Gratian devoted most of *Distinctiones* 15 and 16 to enumerating the
canonically authoritative councils and synods.

In addition to textual material strictly defined as canons ("decrees of
pontiffs" and "statutes of councils"), Gratian drew on other sources
which, if not canons according to the narrower technical definition,
could be treated as authoritative in a more general sense. The most
important of these *auctoritates* were drawn from the writings of major
patristic figures such as Ambrose (†397), Jerome (†419 or 420),
Augustine (†430), and Gregory (†604), whom later generations considered
doctors of the church.[27] It is easy to see how works such as Ambrose
of Milan's *De officiis* ("On duties")---a Christian answer to the work
of Cicero with the same title---could be a rich source of norms. Gratian
provides an explicit list of "the works of the holy fathers that are
received in the Catholic Church."[28] (It is necessary to distinguish
the papal from the patristic when dealing with figures like Gregory.
While textual excerpts from the letters found in the registers of
Gregory clearly derive their authority from the fact that Gregory was
pope, a text like the *Moralia in Job* has an authority to a large
extent independent of the formal ecclesiastical office Gregory
held.)[29]

Finally, in addition to excerpts from works of patristic authors,
another source for extra-canonical authorities was secular law,
primarily (pre-Justinianic) Roman law but also including the capitulary
legislation of the more important Carolingian emperors ---Charlemagne
(†814), Louis the Pious (†840), and Charles the Bald (†877)---and their
successors.

Up to this point, I have been implicitly referring to Gratian's material
sources, texts such as the *Letters* of Gregory I or the *de Officiis*
of St Ambrose from which the canons in the *Decretum* were ultimately
derived. And in a small number of cases, Gratian did work directly with
material sources. Isidore of Seville's *Etymologies* is an example of a
text from which Gratian probably collected excerpts directly from the
material source. It is also possible that he collected excerpts directly
from Gregory the Great's *Moralia in Job*. But Gratian drew the
overwhelming majority of the canons he compiled in the *Decretum* from
formal sources, predecessor collections containing patristic, conciliar,
and papal (as well as pseudo-papal) authorities, predigested into
canon-sized units of text.

Peter Landau has suggested that Gratian relied primarily on just five
formal sources in writing the Decretum: Anselm of Lucca's *Collectio
canonum*, the pseudo-Ivonian *Collectio Tripartita*, Ivo of Chartes's
*Panormia*, Gregory of San Grisogono's *Polycarpus*, and an anonymous
*Collection in Three Books* (*3L*).[30] This hypothesis is not
universally accepted: Pennington, for example, believes that Gratian may
have also relied on one or more now-lost Central Italian collections
similar to the *Collection in Nine Books* (*9L*).[31]

By the end of the Patristic period, the canons of the ecumenical and of
historically important provincial councils constituted a substantial
body of canon law, which were gathered into collections such as the
*Collectio Dionysiana* (ca. 500). A later revision of the *Dionysiana*,
the *Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana* (774), exercised enormous influence on
the transmission of canon law to the Carolingian world and through it to
medieval Western Europe.

Collectors like Dionysius Exiguus (†ca. 540), the original compiler of
the *Collectio Dionysiana*, located all authority in the distant past.
This attitude prevailed throughout the period during which the canonical
sources later used by Gratian were being compiled. Law, however,
ultimately has to correspond with and respond to the needs of
contemporary society, and by the ninth century the Church, especially
north of the Alps, was operating in a very different political and
social environment from that of the Mediterranean world of late
antiquity, which had produced the sources for Dionysius's collection.
When faced with the need for new law to cope with new circumstances,
some enterprising Carolingian churchmen took more recent
material---mostly canons from provincial synods---and repackaged them,
attributing them to popes from the first century through Gregory I
(†604). The compilers of these collections are usually referred to as
"forgers," a convention I will observe in the following discussion, but
they were not simply inventing their sources. Most of the material in
the collections was genuine but of relatively recent origin---the goal
of the forgers was simply to retroject it far enough into the past to
meet the standard they set for authoritativeness.

In order to understand the intent of the forgers, one has to understand
the immediate political situation to which they were reacting.
Charlemagne's son and successor, Emperor Louis the Pious (†840), was
dethroned by three of his sons in a ceremony of public penance in 833.
When Louis was unexpectedly restored less than six months later, he
moved quickly to depose many of the bishops who had participated in
imposing the penance on him, starting with Ebbo, archbishop of
Rheims.[32] The forgers wanted to protect bishops from being deprived of
office by emperor, king, or metropolitan. They did this by building up
the pope as the only superior who could judge a bishop. This was
convenient, because while popes in the ninth century had considerable
moral authority north of the Alps, they had little real power. The
intent of the forgers' program therefore was to render bishops
effectively impervious to judgment. The collections that resulted from
this effort, the so-called Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals* and *Benedictus
Levita*, were accepted everywhere as genuine in an age lacking any
serious historical-critical awareness, and they survived to become
important sources for canonical collectors in the eleventh century.[33]
Many of these forged canons eventually found their way into Gratian's
*Decretum*.

The reform papacy that reached its apogee with the pontificate of
Hildebrand, who reigned as Gregory VII from 1073 to 1085, provided a new
impetus for the collection and study of canons. The special concerns of
the Gregorian reformers also shaped their approach to the collection and
presentation of canons. The consuming interest of the reform generation
was the relationship between *regnum* and *sacerdotium* (church and
state). This interest in the problem of church-state relations was
instrumental: the ultimate concern of the eleventh-century reformers, as
it had been for their eighth- and ninth-century Carolingian
predecessors, was for the reform and renewal of monastic and clerical
life. Unlike the Carolingians, however, who had thought that cooperation
between ecclesiastical and secular authorities was essential for the
reform of religious life, the eleventh-century reformers believed that
secular rulers had to acknowledge the jurisdictional supremacy of the
papacy and the independence of the church from lay interference as a
necessary precondition for effective clerical and monastic reform. It is
significant that the most important canon law collections of the reform
period were compiled by prelates sympathetic with the reform movement,
such as Anselm, bishop of Lucca (†1086), compiler of the *Collectio
canonum*; Gregory, cardinal of San Grisogono (†1113), compiler of the
*Polycarpus*; and Ivo, bishop of Chartres (†1115), compiler of the
*Panormia*. Burchard of Worms (†1025) was a forerunner of this group.
Although he died before the reform papacy or the investiture
controversy, his *Decretum* has more in common with collections compiled
during that period, insofar as it is systematic and reflects concerns
similar to those of his successors.

Unsurprisingly, given their concern with asserting the jurisdictional
supremacy of the papacy and the independence of the church from lay
interference, the eleventh-century collectors showed considerable
interest in the forged decretals of the ninth century. For example, 252
of the 315 chapters of the anonymous *Collection in 74 Titles* (ca.
1050) are drawn from the Pseudo-Isidorian *Decretals*.[34]

The program of the Gregorian reformers collided with two practical
realities of eleventh-century life. Abbotts and bishops were large
landowners and therefore important vassals of secular rulers.
Furthermore, secular rulers were almost completely dependent on the
Church for administrative personnel until the rise of university
faculties of Roman law in the twelfth century. It was therefore
essential from the point of view of secular rulers that they should be
able to control appointments to key benefices in order to ensure the
loyalty of their holders. The controversy over this issue dominated
papal-imperial relations for half a century. It was finally resolved by
the Concordat of Worms (1122), which provided that key benefices were to
be filled through regular canonical processes free from lay interference
(such as election by a cathedral chapter) but that the benefice holder
should swear fealty to the secular ruler for his fiefs.

Gratian depended on a relatively small number of eleventh- and early
twelfth-century systematic canonical collections, his formal sources,
and those predecessor collections, in turn, depended on an older stratum
of mostly chronologically arranged canonical collections. Gratian was
thus selecting from a body of canonical material that had already passed
through a fairly rigorous filtering process, and two of the most
important filters---the ninth-century pseudo-Isidorian forgers and the
eleventh-century Gregorian reformers---had had extremely strong
ideological orientations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Presentation

Having considered how Gratian sourced and collected his materials---the
question of what canons are and where Gratian got them---we now turn to
the question of how Gratian presented and organized the canons he had
collected. Here, it is important to distinguish between presentation,
the small-grain or micro structure of the *Decretum*, and organization,
the large-grain or macro structure of the *Decretum*. The organization
of the *Decretum* is very regular, so structurally regular, in fact,
that Reuter and Silagi's OCP e-text of the Friedberg edition can be
taken apart using a recursive descent parser[35] and should be thought
of as a sequence of hierarchically nested containers. Taking a bottom-up
approach, we will first consider the presentation or small-grain
structure, and start with chapters (*capitula*), atomic containers out
of which the higher-order containers in the *Decretum*---parts,
distinctions, cases, and questions---are constructed.

Chapters in Parts I and II of the *Decretum* typically consist of an
inscription, a rubric, a canon text, and a *dictum post canonem*,
literally meaning "something said after the canon" and usually
abbreviated d.p.c. There are no *dicta post canones* in Part III, which
is in this respect more similar to the formal source collections Gratian
relied on than to the rest of the *Decretum*. The discussion that
follows focuses on inscriptions, rubrics, and *dicta post canones*;
canon texts have been discussed in the section above on the collection
and selection of canons, and nothing further need be added here.

Most canons have an inscription, which identifies the ultimate source of
authority for that canon, usually a papal decretal, a canon from an
ecumenical council or an important provincial synod, or a patristic
text.[36] Because Gratian collected his texts almost exclusively from
formal sources, rather than material sources like the register of Pope
Gregory I,[37] the inscription affixed to a canon was sometimes
historically inaccurate, especially if the text in question was one
derived from the Pseudo-Isidorian collections.

Canons are often, though not always, introduced by a rubric. The name
refers to the fact that rubrics were conventionally written in red
(*ruber*) ink in manuscripts. A rubric is a very short summary of what
the following canon is about. In many cases the rubric simply reads "*de
eodem*", which means "about the same thing" as the preceding canon. The
137 *de eodem* rubrics introducing first-recension canons turn out to be
important clues into the development of the text of the *Decretum*.[38]
Stephan Kuttner observed in 1984 that "in the course its composition the
material outgrew the original plan so that many untidy seams of the
texture remain visible."[39] Canons that are introduced by *de eodem*
rubrics but that are clearly not "about the same thing" as the preceding
canon in the vulgate *Decretum* are notable instances of visibly "untidy
seams". One of Winroth's strongest arguments that the Aa, Bc, Fd, and P
manuscripts represent a first recension rather than an abbreviation of
the *Decretum* is that otherwise problematic *de eodem* rubrics make
sense in the sequential order in which canons appear in those
manuscripts (e.g., the *de eodem* rubric for C.24 q.3 c.5 refers back to
C.24 q.3 c.2, which it consecutively follows in the first
recension).[40]

Eichbauer and Pennington believe that Gratian wrote the rubrics in the
*Decretum* rather than reusing those he found in formal source
collections.[41] The rubrics are far too short to be of value for the
purpose of authorship attribution. On the other hand, the fact that they
are believed to have been written by Gratian, and therefore reflect his
choice of wording, means that they could potentially be useful evidence
in the search for new topics introduced between the first and second
recensions.

A chapter in the formal sources from which Gratian selected his material
typically included an inscription, a rubric, and a canon text. Gratian
added a *dictum post canonem* containing his own commentary on the
preceding canon or series of canons, a feature he borrowed from Alger of
Liège's theological treatise *De misericordia et iustitia* but without
immediate precedent in the canonical literature.[42] The *dicta post
canones* are statements that Gratian made on his own authority as a
jurist, carry the thread of his argument, and do his interpretive work.
The *dicta* are texts that Gratian (whether we think of him as one
person or many) actually wrote, and are therefore subject to analysis
for authorship attribution. "The *dicta* in Gratian's *Decretum* bring
the reader closer to its author than any other part of the text."[43]

[2] "Given this lack of reliable extrinsic evidence, our best source of
evidence about Gratian is his book(s)." (John C. Wei, *Gratian the
Theologian*, Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Canon Law, Volume 13
(Washington, D.C: Catholic University of America Press, 2016), 33).

[3] Manuscripts of Gratian's *Decretum* are frequently referred to in
recent scholarly literature by two-letter abbreviations or *sigla*
derived from their shelfmarks. A reference to Sg (to use a particularly
controversial example) is much more compact and memorable than one to
Sankt Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek 673. Rudolf Weigand (†1998) generated the
original list of *sigla* in the course of his groundbreaking study of
early glossed manuscripts of the *Decretum*, (*Die Glossen zum "Dekret"
Gratians: Studien zu den frühen Glossen und Glosskompositionen*, Studia
Gratiana 25-26 (Rome, 1991)). In the context of Weigand's study early
means before 1216, when Johannes Teutonicus (†1245) finalized the
ordinary gloss, or standardized commentary, on the *Decretum*.
Manuscripts falling outside the original scope of Weigand's
investigation are now assigned *sigla* following the pattern he set. For
example, Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, nouvelles acquisitions
latines 1761, although an extremely important and early (possible the
earliest) manuscript of the *Decretum*, was not glossed, and was
therefore not assigned a *siglum* by Weigand. On the advice of Weigand,
Winroth supplied the *siglum* P by which the manuscript is now commonly
identified: "it was Rudolf Weigand who came up with it. I had asked him
what siglum this ms should have, since I thought all of the two-letter
ones that started with a P had been taken. He said to use only P,
'because it is such an important manuscript'." (Anders Winroth email to
Paul Evans, October 1, 2018) (Although the *sigla* in Weigand's
*Handschriftenliste* adhere consistently to the two-letter convention,
some of the *sigla* supplied by other scholars deviate from it, e.g., P,
Pfr.)

Cambridge University Press, 2000), 32.

[5] Atria A. Larson, “An Abbreviatio of the First Recension of Gratian’s
Decretum in Munich?” *Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law* 29 (2011): 51–118.

[6] "The second recension contains 3,945 canons (including the paleae)
in the editions. The first recension contains only 1,860 canons (47
percent)." (Winroth, *The Making of Gratian’s Decretum*, 122) The
division of distinctions and questions into canons is a matter of
editorial opinion and therefore unavoidably conventional. The
generally-cited number of 3,945 comes from Friedberg's introduction (edF
1.xii). Furthermore, many canons include more than one canon text, and
the conventional number obfuscates the distinction between the canon
defined as a container or package and the canon text or texts included
within it. The Reuter and Silagi e-text of the Friedberg edition has
3,848 canons (identified by the OCP `<4 N>` tag, where N is the canon
number) containing 4,394 distinct canon texts (identified by the OCP
`<T T>` tag). (Note: `egrep "<T T>.*<T T>" edF.txt` to find the three
lines where the canon text tag occurs twice on the same line.)

[7] "The first recension of the *Decretum* was not a living text. It was
a finished product which its author considered ready to be circulated.
This is evident from its text, which is as much a finished and polished
product as could be expected of any twelfth-century text. Further, it is
also evident from the fact that the first recension survives in one
version only; what differences there are among the manuscripts are all
minor (the apparent exception of Aa will be discussed below). They are
differences one would expect to find in any manuscript tradition,
arising from scribal mistake or ingenuity. In other words, the
manuscripts do not represent different stages in the development of the
text, in the manner of 'classically' living texts, such as the *Song of
Roland*, where each different manuscript version has an equally valid
claim to authenticity." (Winroth, 130).

[8] "In the interests of simplicity and clarity, I have therefore chosen
to call the author of the first recension Gratian 1 and the author of
the second recension Gratian 2. These labels are not intended to suggest
that Gratian 1 and Gratian 2 could not have been the same person."
(Winroth, 122) "It is impossible to draw any certain conclusions, but
the evidence presented in the last two chapters supports the view that
that two recensions had difference authors." (Winroth, 194–95).

refusal to apply the standard label of 'canonical collection' to the
*Decretum* is meant to make clear that I do not classify the rest of the
*Decretum Gratiani* as a canonical collection in the exact way that the
work of Regino, Burchard, Anselm of Lucca, or even Ivo of Chartres (and
many anonymous compilers) was, and yet it was a canonical collection in
many respects, especially considering much of its source material and
how it was used. Many abbreviations of the *Decretum*, for instance, are
clear testimony that some religious houses and episcopal courts wanted
the canons, not the *dicta*; they wanted a pure canonical collection
that could serve as a reference manual to the church's law."

[15] In earlier collections such as the *Collectio Dionysiana* (ca.500)
the material was organized chronologically.

[16] 302,384 words or 71.2% of the vulgate *Decretum*.

[17] The prologue was prepended (in slightly different forms) to both
the *Decretum* and *Panormia* of Ivo of Chartres. For the edited Latin
text, see (Bruce Clark Brasington, ed., *Ways of Mercy: The Prologue of
Ivo of Chartres ; Edition and Analysis*, Vita Regularis, Bd. 2 (Münster
: Piscataway, N.J: LIT ; Distributed in North America by Transaction
Publishers, 2004)) For an English translation, see (Somerville and
Brasington, *Prefaces to Canon Law Books in Latin Christianity*,
132–58).

[18] "Master Gratian, antonomastically called in this work 'the Master,'
**in place of an introduction** prefaced his book with the following
title, *Concord of discordant canons*, by which he precisely sets forth
subject matter and intention. Somerville and Brasington, *Prefaces to
Canon Law Books in Latin Christianity*, 201. **Add quote in Latin. As
noted above (Chapter 1), the title comes from a gloss, not from
Gratian.**

[19] 81,008 words or 19.1%.

[20] "There are two difficulties when this authorship comes to be
determined. One is that the *Concordia* is a book in three distinctive
parts, with several distinctive sections within the parts, and these
parts have undergone editing as to chapter heading, chapter insertions,
and chapter order. Whatever the later formal ascription, is Gratian
responsible for all these parts? The other difficulty is the range of
roles the one 'responsible' person might have had---compiler,
commentator, rubricator, reviser. Was Gratian one or all? The
difficulties relate to one another, because evidence that Gratian was,
say, the commentator of Part II does not establish what role he had in
Part I." (Noonan, “Gratian Slept Here,” 162–63).

[23] In addition to genuine papal material, for example a large number
of excerpts from the register containing the letters of Gregory I,
Gratian used a number of pseudo-papal sources, which will be discussed
below in the context of Gratian's formal sources.

[27] Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory the Great, and Jerome were formally
recognized as doctors by Boniface VIII in 1298 in the *Liber* *Sextus*,
VI 3.22, *Gloriosus Deus in sanctis suis* in *De reliquiis et

[29] "The *Moralia*: based on talks Gregory gave on the Book of Job to
his 'brethren' who accompanied him to Constantinople while he held the
office of papal *apocrisiarius* (see above). The work as we have it is
the result of Gregory's revision and completion of it soon after his
accession to the papal office." R. A. Markus, *Gregory the Great and His
World* (Cambridge ; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 15. "In
the case of Gratian's chapters from Gregory I's *Moralia in Job*, the
unusually precise citations in Gratian's inscriptions lead to the
conclusion that he used this work directly (as Munier already argued)."

were taken from Pseudo-Isidore." (J. T. Gilchrist, ed., *The Collection

[35] See Appendix 2 for the Python code listing for my implementation of
the recursive-descent parser. Thanks to Patricio Simari of the
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at The Catholic
University of America, who provided helpful suggestions on parser
implementation. In Computer Science-theoretic terms, the parsed
*Decretum* can be thought of as an ordered tree, with parts,
distinctions, cases, and questions as interior nodes. A canon or
chapter, properly conceptualized as a node encapsulating rubrics,
inscriptions, canon texts, and *dicta post canones*, is also an internal
node. A *dictum* (*ante* or *post canonem*, or *initiale*) is a terminal
node. So are rubrics, inscriptions, and canon texts. A case statement
(*dictum initiale*) is always the first terminal node of a case. A
*dictum ante canonem* is always the first terminal node of a distinction
or question. The anomalous C.16 q.2 d.a.c.8 is actually the *dictum ante
canonem* introducing a vestigial fifth question positioned between C.16
q.2 and C.16 q.3 (see Friedberg, 1.787). The traditional notation
misleadingly implies that d.a.c.1 is a leaf node of c.1. In fact,
d.a.c.1 and c.1 are both child nodes at the same nesting level under one
parent distinction or question node. A *dictum post canonem* is an
optional, and usually final, terminal node of a canon.

[36] The distinction between rubrics and *dicta* is blurry: "Gratian ...
often melded the rubrics with the dicta." (Melodie Harris Eichbauer,
“St. Gall Stiftsbibliothek 673 and the Early Redactions of Gratian’s
Decretum,” *Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law* 27 (2007): 107). "Both J.
Rambaud-Buhot and John Noonan, Jr. have highlighted the similarity
between dicta and rubrics, that is, a rubric very often echoes the
dictum that immediately preceded it." and "These isolated instances in
the first cluster show that Gratian felt that the dictum was sufficient
for summarizing the following *auctoritas*." (Eichbauer, 115) **Expand
to include inscriptions.**

[37] "Since Gratian frequently took fragments of letters from the
Register of Gregory I---266 in all---using the inscription 'in
registro', older research assumed that he must have used this important
source in the form of the *Registrum Hadrianum*. According to more
recent research (Landau), even these texts from the Register of Gregory
I found in Gratian derive almost without exception from canonical
collections predating Gratian; the direct use of the Register is
probable in only a single case." \[C.27 q.1 c.19 (JE 1496)\] (Landau,
“Gratian and the Decretum Gratiani,” 34).

[38] Winroth observed that there are 398 *de eodem* rubrics in the
vulgate *Decretum*, see (Anders Winroth, “Uncovering Gratian’s Original
Decretum with the Help of Electronic Resources,” *Columbia Library
Columns* 46, no. 1 (1997): 28); and (Winroth, *The Making of Gratian’s
Decretum*, 127). The precision of this frequently-cited number can be
refined in ways that demonstrate the true power of the careful use of
electronic resources for the study of this, or any, text. (In the
following examples, `edF.txt` is the filename of the OCP-format Reuter
and Silagi e-text of the Friedberg edition. The commands used in the
examples should work on any macOS or Linux-based system.) Winroth's
figure of 398 simply represents the number of occurrences of the
substring "de eodem" in the file: `grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | wc -l`
returns 398. Most, but not all, of the occurrences of the substring "de
eodem" do, in fact, appear in the context of a rubric, In one case, *de
Cons.* D.2 c.3, the inscription reads *Idem de eodem* ("the same person
about the same thing"), and refining the search to count those
occurrences that do **not** appear alongside the OCP rubric `<T R>` or
inscription `<T I>` tags reveal that in 8 instances, the words *de
eodem* are simply part of the text of a canon or *dictum*:
`grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | egrep -v "<T R>|<T I>" | wc -l` returns 8.
Setting aside, then, those instances in which the words *de eodem* occur
in canons, *dicta*, or inscriptions (and acknowledging that the criteria
for distinguishing between inscriptions and rubrics can be blurry)
leaves 389 rubrics containing the substring "de eodem":
`grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l` returns 389. Of
those 389, there are 373 *De eodem* rubrics and 13 *Item de eodem*
rubrics (12 of those 13 introduce second-recension canons in D.30 in the
first part of the *Decretum*):
`fgrep "De eodem." edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l` returns 373, and
`fgrep "Item de eodem." edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | wc -l` returns 13. In
the three remaining cases, words *de eodem* are part of a longer rubric:
`grep -i "de eodem" edF.txt | grep "<T R>" | fgrep -v "De eodem." | fgrep -v "Item de eodem."`
returns the rubrics for D.23 c.32 (*De eodem, et ut clerici comam non
nutriant*), C.22 q.5 c. 16 (*De eodem, et ut a ieiunis iuramenta
prestentur*), and *de Cons.* D.1 c.17 (*De eodem, et quod octo diebus
dedicationum*). Winroth's larger point, however, had to do with the
place of the *de eodem* rubrics in the "untidy seams" problem. For that
purpose, only the 137 *de eodem* rubrics in the first recension of the
Decretum are potentially relevant evidence. **See GitHub
[Sand](https://github.com/decretist/Sand/tree/master/rubrics)
repository. This result (137) is potentially off by one, i.e., the total
number of *de eodem* rubrics in the first and second recension rubric
data sets is 388 instead of 389, with no way to tell whether the missing
rubric is from the first or second recension.**

edition, (*Alger von Lüttichs Traktat "De misericordia et iustitia": ein
kanonistischer Konkordanzversuch aus der Zeit des Investiturstreits:
Untersuchungen und Edition*, Quellen und Forschungen zum Recht im
Mittalter, Bd. 2 (Sigmaringen: J. Thorbecke, 1985)). Somewhat
confusingly for Gratian scholars, Kretzschmar uses regular typeface for
Alger's *dicta* and italics for the canons, the opposite of the
convention adopted by Friedberg and maintained by Winroth.
