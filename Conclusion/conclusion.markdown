The first result of the investigation presented in this dissertation is
positive. It is that the case statements or *themata* were written by a
single author whose words appear nowhere else in the *Decretum*. The
author of the case statements was *not* the author of the first- or
second-recension *dicta* or of the *dicta* in *de Penitentia*. I have
designated this single author of the case statements Gratian 0 to
distinguish him from Gratian 1 and Gratian 2, the authors of the first-
and second-recension *dicta* hypothesized by Winroth, and I take Gratian
0 to be *the* historical Gratian. That the case statements have a single
author is not surprising, but that they were not written by the
author(s) of any of the *dicta* is quite unexpected. This finding is
supported both by the values for Burrows's Delta and the results of
principal component analysis.[1] This result warrants a high degree of
confidence, and future conjectural *novelle* will have to account for
the fact that the case statements were not written by the author of
either the first- or second-recension *dicta*.

The second result is negative. It is that principal component analysis
(PCA) does not produce either of the two findings that might reasonably
be expected on the basis of recent scholarly debate over the authorship
of the *Decretum*. The PCA results do not show samples from the first-
and second-recension *dicta* forming a single tight cluster in a way
that would support Pennington's single-author hypothesis. Neither do
they show the samples from the first- and second-recension *dicta*
forming two distinct tight clusters cleanly separated from each other in
an unambiguously bimodal distribution that would support Winroth's
two-author hypothesis. Any attempt to make an argument on the basis of
the results of principal component analysis in favor of either the one-
or two-author hypothesis would be unpersuasive. Considering the *dicta*
from *de Penitentia* as a third body of *dicta* separate and distinct
from the first- and second-recension *dicta* complicates the picture
further still. The most that we can say is that both the
second-recension *dicta* and the *dicta* from *de Penitentia* display
some degree of loose clustering, in that most samples from those
collections of *dicta* appear in the same quadrant, and that both
display some degree of separation from the first-recension *dicta*.
These results are not compatible either with there having been a single
author who wrote both the first- and second-recension *dicta* or with
there having been a single author who wrote the first-recension *dicta*
for both *de Penitentia* and the rest of the *Decretum*. This second,
negative, finding does not warrant the same level of confidence as the
first, positive, result and represents a call for further investigation.

The statement that Gratian is the author of the *Decretum* is a
convenient shorthand in which the *Decretum* as a whole stands
synecdochically for the *dicta*. Gratian scholars are in no danger of
being misled by this shorthand. But they are in danger of being misled
by the implied statement that one Gratian was the author of the *dicta*.

Scholarship on the *Decretum* in the aftermath of Noonan's debunking of
the traditional Gratian legendary and Winroth's discovery of the first
recension has taken for granted that either one or two authors wrote the
*dicta* and that either the one author or the first of the two authors
(Gratian 1) wrote the case statements or *themata*. When I started work
on this project in 2013, I accepted that assumption and fully expected
stylometric results for the *dicta* (including the case statements) to
be consistent with either Pennington's one-author hypothesis or
Winroth's two-author hypothesis. My intention was simply to expand what
I perceived to be an insufficient evidentiary basis for the debate over
whether the *dicta* had one or two authors. However, it became clear at
a very early stage of the project that the case statements, or
*themata*, were instead written by a single author (Gratian 0) whose
words appear nowhere else in the *Decretum*.

Contrary to expectation, none of the stylometric evidence produced at
any stage of the project was compatible with either the one- or
two-Gratian hypothesis for the authorship of the *dicta*, none of which
were written by Gratian 0. I became convinced that the individual
*dicta* have to be distinguished from the *themata* and that it is not
consistent with the stylometric evidence to think of the collection as a
work of literature written by either a single author or two authors. The
*dicta* are more coherent than a gloss collection but less coherent than
a treatise. What we have in the *dicta* is a collection of texts by
several authors and what we need is some idea of how that collection was
composed. Much of the post-Noonan scholarship on the authorship of the
*Decretum* has engaged in what I have referred to as a "quest of the
historical Gratian." However, it appears that to search for one or more
historical Gratians behind the collection of *dicta* is to ask a
question that is incapable of producing a meaningful answer.

How are we then to make sense of these unexpected results?

The first questions to be answered about how the collection was composed
are where and when it came into existence. I see no reason to call into
question the scholarly consensus that the *Decretum* emerged from the
overlapping circles concerned with legal questions in early
twelfth-century Bologna. The traditional assumption that Gratian worked
in Bologna is almost the only feature of the Gratian legendary that
Noonan did not seriously challenge,[2] and the development of Bologna as
a center for the study of Roman and, somewhat later, canon law clearly
seems to have benefited from the cluster effect so familiar in our age
because of the concentration of technology industries in California's
Silicon Valley and Route 128 in Boston.

That the case statements were both quite stable from an early stage in
the evolution of the text of the *Decretum* (only 13 words were added,
to C.19 d.init., in the second recension) and that they were written by
an author whose words appear in none of the *dicta* argues---strongly, I
think---that the textual development of the *Decretum* started early,
perhaps in the mid-1120s, and that the case statements were not written
after the fact to scaffold more-or-less finished treatments of the
cases.

The *Marturi placitum* (1076) is evidence that the Roman law strand of
the legal revolution had a lengthy prehistory---a long period of slow
growth during which the number of people involved was quite
small---before it broke the surface into historical visibility thirty
years later in the first decade of the twelfth century. Regarding the
study of canon law, the evidence I have presented suggests that a small
group formed around Gratian, the author of the *themata*, the members of
which wrote the *dicta*. The efforts of Gratian and his circle became
visible only after 1140. If the development of canon law studies
followed the same pattern of exponential growth after a long period of
quiet work that the study of Roman law did, it would not be unreasonable
to posit that the circle around Gratian had been at work for more than a
decade by 1140. (Pennington has argued for a long period of textual
development for the *Decretum*, while Winroth has argued that Roman and
canon law studies were nowhere near as fully developed by the end of the
1130s as previously thought. These arguments have been thought of as
being at odds, not least by Pennington and Winroth themselves, but I
prefer to think of them as intuitions, from different starting points,
of the same process of exponential growth, and, therefore, in some sense
both right.)

The textual stability and unique authorship of the case statements, as
well as the inferred analogy between the early pattern of growth of the
study of Roman law and canon law, suggest, then, that Gratian's project
was in progress by the mid-1120s. If that tentative dating is correct,
it seems plausible to connect the beginnings of Gratian's project with
new understandings of the church as an independent political and
juridical community in the aftermath of the Concordat of Worms (1122)
and the First Lateran Council (1123). I believe that it is reasonable to
assume that the historical Gratian was, when he initiated the project,
someone who had carefully read around a half-dozen important reform-era
formal source collections. He was aware in a general way of how the new
schools in northern France approached textual problems and, in
particular, of the hermeneutical approach to reading the canons outlined
in Ivo's *Prologue*, although Ivo left the application of his
hermeneutic as an exercise to the reader. However, Ivo's method presumes
that one is interested in reconciling the contradictions between one
canon and another or, at most, one carefully circumscribed selection of
canons and another similarly circumscribed set. Gratian seems to have
arrived at the crucial insight that the new period in church history
inaugurated by the Concordat of Worms and the First Lateran Council
required a system of canonical jurisprudence of a comprehensiveness that
the reform-era collections had simply not contemplated and that a
reconciliation of the contradictions in a selection of canons large
enough to be generally representative of the tradition as a whole must
provide the foundation for such a comprehensive system.

<!--

I think that it is also important to note that one of the things
Gratian brought to the project from the outset was a fundamentally
conservative and optimistic disposition: his was the antithesis of
Peter Abelard's project of subverting and even dissolving the whole
notion of authority by showing that the authorities were in actual,
not just apparent, disagreement. (I think the depiction of Gratian
smiling in *Paradiso* 10.103 and in the 18th century engraving that
Winroth has popularized on the internet does actually capture
something significant about the optimistic outlook that he brought
to his engagement with the authorities.)

  -->

The historical Gratian is often said to have created a collection of
canons that he used in the earliest course on canon law, <!--
and may also have written a few of the comments that are now part
of the collection of *dicta* --> but we must be extremely careful about
precisely what we mean when we say that the collection was "used in the
earliest course on canon law." At some point in the mid-1120s, Gratian
became the convener of a study group that read the canons and started to
work out a systematic jurisprudence based on them. That there was such a
group is revealed by the evidence that the *dicta* of the first
recension were written by multiple contributors and that these additions
to the text were added to a single work organized into cases, each with
a *thema*. Had the writers of the *dicta* worked independently of
Gratian and one another, their work would have been scattered in many
copies of the cases, if it survived at all. So, the production of the
first recension, with case statements and *dicta*, implies the existence
of the study group. The formation of the study group was obviously a
crucial step in the development of canon law as a discipline, but to
call it "the earliest course on canon law" is to anachronistically read
back into its earliest stage the later evolution of the circle into a
school, then a faculty, and finally a university. We can infer that in
the early stage of his and the study group's work Gratian had a good
command of the sources, but he was not yet in possession of a method for
reconciling the contradictions presented by the canons fully developed
enough to be systematically imparted to students, which is the
fundamental prerequisite for a university program. He did not at this
stage know so much more than the other participants in the study group
that we can unambiguously call him *magister* and them *discipuli*, even
if he was the group's central figure and the one whose name was
transmitted to later generations of canonists.

<!--

We can almost certainly say that, when the study group convened,
Gratian 0 knew a great deal about the canonical tradition from his
study of the earlier collections, but we cannot say what the members
of the group contributed to the organization of the canons into a
topical arrangement. However, we can say that Gratian 0 greatly
enhanced its significance and usefulness by writing the *themata*
or case statements.

  -->

Gratian's first important insight, that a comprehensive reconciliation
of contradictory canons was the necessary foundation for a systematic
jurisprudence, is probably what led him in the first instance to gather
a circle to study the problem. Gratian's second important insight, that
hypothetical cases could provide an effective framework for the
comprehensive reconciliation he envisioned, probably emerged organically
out of the work of the circle. It is unlikely that Gratian had written
the case statements <!-- as a framework for
organizing the canons thematically --> before the formation of the study
group. Indeed, the existence of the case statements in written form
makes little sense outside the context of the work of the study group.
One has to think that Gratian developed them as a result of the earliest
group readings and discussions.

So, the evidence seems to show that the person later identified as
Gratian performed two distinct roles in the evolution of the text of the
first recension, as author and as authority. Gratian 0 appears to be the
author of the 3,592 words of the first-recension case statements or
*themata* in the literal sense of having formulated their exact wording.
The case statements were Gratian 0's only direct contribution to the
text of the *Decretum*, and his authorial signature appears nowhere else
in the corpus of *dicta*.[3] Unlike Winroth's Gratian 1 and Gratian 2,
Gratian 0 is clearly one person. The facts that the case statements were
written by a single author whose words appear nowhere else in the
*Decretum*, that they appear to have been written as a product of the
work of a study group, and that almost no changes were made to their
wording during those stages of the development of the *Decretum* for
which we have textual evidence, all support, in my opinion, arguments
that the development of the text likely started in the mid-1120s and
that the collection of *dicta* as a whole grew to its classical form
over fifteen to twenty years.

<!--

Why did Gratian 0 make no direct contribution to the text of the
*Decretum* other than the case statements or *themata*? I suspect
that it was because his written Latin was not as good as that of
other members of the study group. (See discussion in Chapter 3
*supra* of the use of reflexives in C.3 d.init. and C.29 d.init.)
I think it is natural to assume that Gratian was older than the
other members of the study group: teachers are, after all, usually
older than their students. Stipulating to Winroth's argument that
the Siena necrology indicates that Gratian died on 10 August 1144
or 1145 as bishop of Chiusi, and guessing that he was probably
around age 60 at the time of his death, means that Gratian would
have received the early Latin grammar-intensive portions of his
education before 1100. That may not have been enough to keep up
with his students as the standards of Latin composition rose as the
twelfth century advanced.

[As an aside, I think the anomalous Latin was what most convinced
Winroth that I was onto something after I told him that the case
statements were not written by the same author(s) who wrote the
first-recension *dicta*. He was non-committal the first time I
presented my results to him in 2013 or 2014, but at the Stephan
Kuttner Institute event at Yale in 2015 he told me he was convinced
because "ever since you pointed that out to me, I've noticed that
his Latin is just not that good."]

  -->

Moving beyond the exact wording of the first-recension case statements,
the second, and probably more significant, contribution to the
development of the *Decretum* made by the figure later identified as
Gratian was as the leader of the study group. It was Gratian's method of
using hypothetical cases as a framework for applying the hermeneutical
principles proposed in Ivo's *Prologue* for reconciling the
contradictions presented by the canons that came to be memorialized in
the first-recension *dicta*. As I said above, I do not think that
Gratian worked out his methods, arguments, and solutions before the
study group formed. Rather, I think he worked them out as he guided the
group in its efforts to resolve the contradictions between the canons.
It was in that context that he created his program---the organization of
the canons into hypothetical cases, which he defined in his *themata*.

Members of the group clearly accepted as authoritative Gratian's
fundamental insight that the canonical tradition inherited from earlier
collections could and should be organized into a comprehensive system of
jurisprudence that would constitute the law of the church, as well as
his method of reconciling canons. They passed down to later students of
canon law the understanding that Gratian was the author of the
*Decretum* both in the sense that it reflected this fundamental insight
and in the sense that it was his method, and therefore his authority,
that lay behind the particular reading of the canons the collection
embodied. Although the words of the *dicta* are demonstrably not his,
the fact that his name came to be attached to the text strongly suggests
that both the fundamental insight and method were his and that these
foundational contributions were the basis for the authority claim made
on Gratian's behalf by the community of legal scholars the original
study group gave rise to.

Gratian 0 continued to contribute to the work as long as the first
recension was under active development by the study group, which by the
mid-1130s had evolved into something that could serve as the basis for a
university course, or even a sequence of courses. I think Winroth is
right that the person called Gratian was not a contributor to the second
recension.

<!--

In fact, the first recension can probably be safely (if circularly)
defined as that stage in the textual development of the *Decretum*
which Gratian 0 still personally guided. That is something of a
non-answer, as it does not put an end-date on Gratian's active
involvement in the evolution of the text. He could have remained
involved until he got a benefice (possibly the bishopric of Chiusi,
c.1143), something he seems to have waited rather longer for than
many of the other early contributors to the project. But the textual
evolution of the first recension seems to have been more or less
complete by the mid-1130s, and, if we believe Noonan and Grebner,
Gratian was still acting as a legal consultant into the early 1140s.
That leaves a gap of a half-decade or so (1136-1143?) when Gratian
could have been, but does not seem to actually have been, involved
with the further evolution of the text. I speculate that after the
mid-1130s, deficiencies in Gratian's knowledge of Roman law, at
least relative to that of other younger member of the loose
proto-faculty, limited his further contributions to the project in
the same way that relative deficiencies in his Latin skills had
limited his contributions as author (as opposed to authority) at
earlier stages of the project.

  -->

Why were the contributors who followed Gratian all anonymous? The
larger-than-expected number of contributors and the apparent absence of
overlap between contributors to the first- and second-recension *dicta*
suggests that the involvement of individual contributors was relatively
brief, perhaps a year or two. One of the most important things the
formation of the study group did for Gratian was to provide him with a
pool of volunteer labor that made it possible to put the collection of
canons and his *themata* on parchment. Why did Gratian attract the group
of collaborators? Involvement in Gratian's project must have created
significant real-world advantages for the contributors, almost certainly
in the form of enhanced competitiveness for benefices, in order to
justify the uncompensated intellectual and scribal labor they put into
it. When ecclesiastical preferment came their way, their involvement in
Gratian's project probably ended. But the fact that they had been
successful attracted others to take their place, a proposition that goes
a long way toward explaining the rapid growth both of the text itself
through the creation of the cases and the collection of *dicta* and of
the community for which the text was the focal point.

The rapid turnover of contributors meant that the study group went
through several "generations" of members between the mid-1120s and
mid-1130s. By the time of Paucapalea in the late 1140s, turnover of
membership in what had by that point become quite a substantial
community was much slower, but there had been so many intervening
"generations" that the only evidence revealing the history of the
project was that incorporated into the text of the *Decretum*. As a
result, Paucapalea did not even know the name of Gratian.

What does all of this say about teachers and the teaching of canon law
between the mid-1120s and 1140? In the 1120s and 1130s, the distinction
between teacher and student was much less clear than it became a few
decades later. Gratian was the leader of the study group, and the figure
to whom the group deferred, because he was the one who had, it seems,
done by far the most reading in the sources of canon law. But reading
widely in the canons was not the same thing as working out a
jurisprudential system based on them, and there was a great deal that
Gratian did not know at that point, such as whether and how to
incorporate Roman law into his system. In some sense, then, Gratian and
the members of the study group were figuring it out together. We should
not think of the Gratian of the 1120s as the kind of guild-certified
master, able to "explain it all for you," that we encounter in the
schools of canon law of later decades.

Although I am uncomfortable with using the terms teacher and student to
describe the relationship between Gratian and the contributors the early
stages of the project, I suspect that by the mid-1130s, we can envision
the ongoing activity around Gratian as having evolved from being a
reading or study group into something more like a course or even a
proto-faculty. Gratian need not have been the only teacher at this later
stage, and some of the early contributors, at least those still working
in Bologna while awaiting a suitable benefice, may well have had
students of their own by that point. As a result, some of the texts that
became part of the collection of *dicta* could have been written by
people who emerged as independent teachers from the study group and some
from students summarizing or reporting on solutions presented by
teachers in classroom discussion.

<!--

This, in turn, is an argument in favor of the case statements having
been one of the first parts of the *Decretum* reduced to a stable
written form. The logical alternative, that case statements were
written after the fact, would have to have taken place late enough
in the development of the text that someone would have noticed.

  -->
<!--

The *dicta* display some locality of reference, i.e., a given
*dictum* is likely to discuss the same or a similar issue, and
presumably to have the same author, as the *dicta* immediately
before and after it.

  -->

[1] Indeed, it is worth reminding the reader here that Burrows's Delta
indicates that the case statements are even less likely to have been
written by the same author as the *dicta* collections in the *Decretum*
than are the samples from the pseudo-Augustinian *De vera et falsa
penitentia* quoted by Gratian in *de Penitentia*.

Father of the Systematic Study of Canon Law,” *Traditio* 35 (January
1979): 162.

[3] Pennington has argued against Winroth's claim that the development
from the first to the second recension of the *Decretum* was
accomplished in a single bound by someone other than the original
Gratian on the grounds that someone would have noticed and remarked on
such an extensive revision of the text by another author: "My main
argument for not accepting the theory that there were two Gratians is
quite simple. It is difficult to imagine that if a Gratian compiled the
pre-Vulgate *Decretum*, and another person doubled the size from ca.
2000 canons to ca. 4000, the first generation of jurists after Gratian
would have not noticed or not known about the second Gratian's work and
blithely attributed what was now a massive work to just 'Gratian.'"
Kenneth Pennington, “The Biography of Gratian, the Father of Canon Law,”
in *A Service Beyond All Recompense*, ed. Kurt Martens (Catholic
University of America Press, 2018), 361–62. He could presumably make a
similar argument against my claim that there was a change in authorship
between the case statements and the first-recension *dicta*.

The later canonists did not notice or know, however, because the
*Decretum* came to the attention of a significant audience only among
the second, not the first, generation of jurists after Gratian. The
earliest significant change to the text to draw widespread notice was
the division of the first part of the *Decretum* into distinctions by
Paucapalea. Paucapalea, though, was far enough removed from the
circumstances surrounding the composition of the text that he does not
appear even to have known the name of its author. Ironically,
Pennington's "someone would have noticed" argument is wrong precisely
because his argument that the text of the *Decretum* underwent a long
and slow process of development is right.
