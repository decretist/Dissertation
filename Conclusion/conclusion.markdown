The case statements or *themata* were written by a single author whose
words appear nowhere else in the *Decretum*. In the spirit of Winroth,
who refers to his hypothesized author of the second-recension *dicta* as
Gratian 2, I have named this figure Gratian 0, and I take him to be
*the* historical Gratian.

How to make sense of this result?

The legal revolution of the twelfth century, the background from which
the *Decretum* emerged, was as much a social as an
intellectual movement. My thinking in reconceptualizing the canon law
strand of the legal revolution of the twelfth century as a social
movement (as opposed to an intellectual movement, as it is usually
treated in the scholarly literature) was strongly influenced by Rodney
Stark's *The Rise of Christianity*.[1] Thinking of the growth of the
systematic study of canon law as a social movement has two significant
implications.

First, social movements of this kind display a pattern of long-tail
exponential growth in which, for a very long time, the number of people
involved is quite small. As a result, evidence of their activities
emerges into the historical record only after a considerable delay. The
*Marturi placitum* (1076) is evidence that the Roman law strand of the
legal revolution had a lengthy prehistory (the long tail) before it
broke the surface into historical visibility thirty years later in the
first decade of the twelfth century. The results of the collective
efforts of the circle we associate with the name of Gratian
(*Gratian-Kreis*) emerge into our field of view only after 1140, at
which point it is not unreasonable to believe that they had been at work
in some form or another for two if not three decades. (Pennington has
argued for a long period of textual development for the *Decretum*,
while Winroth has argued that Roman and canon law studies were nowhere
near as fully developed by the end of the 1130s as previously
thought. These arguments have been thought of as being at odds, not
least by Pennington and Winroth themselves, but I prefer to think of
them as intuitions, from different starting points, of the same process
of long-tail exponential growth, and therefore in some sense both
right.)

Second, participation in the early stages of a successful social
movement confers substantial real-world benefits. Participation in the
circle we associate with the name of Gratian undoubtedly involved a
considerable amount of uncompensated scribal labor, and in order to
explain the exponential growth pattern, there must have been some
substantial real-world benefit that made the effort worthwhile for the
participants. It is not at all hard to guess what that benefit was. The
participants were not interested in teaching as a career. They were
looking for competitive advantage in the race for ecclesiastical
benefices.

The statement that Gratian is the author of the *Decretum* is a
convenient shorthand in which the *Decretum* as a whole stands
synecdochically for the *dicta*. Gratian scholars are in no danger of
being mislead by this shorthand. But they are in danger of being mislead
by the implied statement that Gratian is the author of the *dicta*.

Scholarship on the *Decretum* in the aftermath of Noonan's debunking of
the traditional Gratian legendary and Winroth's discovery of the first
recension has taken for granted that either one or two authors wrote the
*dicta*. When I started work on this project in 2013, I implicitly
accepted that assumption and fully expected stylometric results for the
*dicta* consistent with either Pennington's one-author hypothesis or
Winroth's two-author hypothesis. My intention was simply to expand what
I perceived to be an insufficient evidentiary basis for the debate over
whether the *dicta* had one or two authors. However the results, once I
convinced myself that they were not spurious, convinced me that the
individual *dicta* have to be distinguished from the collection as a
whole and that it is not consistent with the stylometric evidence to
think of the collection as a work of literature with some internal
principle of unity written by either a single author or two authors.

The *dicta* are more coherent than a gloss collection but less coherent
than a treatise. What we have is a collection of texts and what we need
is some idea of how that collection was composed. Much of the
post-Noonan scholarship on the authorship of the *Decretum* has engaged
in what I have referred to as a "quest of the historical Gratian."
However it appears that to search for one or more historical Gratians
behind the collection of *dicta* is to ask a question that is incapable
of producing a meaningful answer.

<!--

The *dicta* display some locality of reference, i.e., a given
*dictum* is likely to discuss the same or a similar issue, and
presumably to have the same author, as the *dicta* immediately
before and after it.

  -->

The historical Gratian is often said to have created a collection of
canons that he used in the earliest course on canon law, <!--
and may also have written a few of the comments that are now part
of the collection of *dicta* --> but we must be extremely careful about
precisely what we mean when we say that Gratian "created a collection of
canons" and especially when we say that the collection was "used in the
earliest course on canon law."

I believe that it is reasonable to assume that the historical Gratian
was, when he initiated the project, someone who had carefully read
around a half-dozen important reform-era formal source collections. He
was aware in a general way of how the new schools in Northern France
approached textual problems, and in particular of the hermeneutical
approach to reading the canons outlined in Ivo's *Prologue* but "left as
an exercise to the reader." I think that it is also important to note
that one of the things Gratian brought to the project from the outset
was a fundamentally conservative and optimistic disposition: his was the
antithesis of Peter Abelard's project of subverting and even dissolving
the whole notion of authority by showing that the authorities were in
actual, not just apparent, disagreement. (I think the depiction of
Gratian smiling in *Paradiso* 10.103 <!-- and in the 18th century
engraving that Winroth has popularized on the internet --> does
actually capture something significant about the optimistic outlook
that he brought to his engagement with the authorities.)

At some point in the 1120s, Gratian became the convener of a study group
that read the canons, and started to work out a systematic jurisprudence
based on them. The formation of the study group was obviously a crucial
step in the development of canon law as a discipline, but I believe it
is something of an anachronism to call it "the earliest course on canon
law." I think we can infer that Gratian at this point had a good command
of the sources, but he was not yet in possession of a fully-developed
method for reconciling the contradictions presented by the canons that
he could systematically impart to students. He did not at this stage
know so much more than the other participants in the study group that we
can unambiguously call him *magister* and them *discipuli*.

One of the most important things the formation of the study group did
for Gratian was to provide him with a pool of volunteer labor that made
it possible to put on parchment the collection of canons he thought
raised the really salient issues and his comments on them. Before the
formation of the study group, I doubt that the collection of canons and
comments had any concrete existence outside of Gratian's head.

<!--

I think your work leads us to a new model of how the classical form
of the *Decretum* came to be. It started with a collection of canons
organized into topical segments. It then grew both by having canons
and topics added to the corpus and by accumulating commentary
(*dicta*).

  -->

The person later identified as Gratian performed two distinct roles in
the evolution of the text of the first recension, as author and as
authority.

First, he appears to be the author of the case statements in the literal
sense of having formulated their exact wording. In his capacity as
literal author of the case statement, I refer to him as Gratian 0, to
distinguish him from Winroth's Gratian 1 and Gratian 2. Unlike Gratian 1
and Gratian 2, Gratian 0 is clearly one person. Gratian 0's only direct
contribution to the text of the *Decretum* was as the writer of the
3,592 words of the first-recension case statements. The case statements
were textually quite stable from an early stage in the project (only 13
words were added, to C.19 d.init., in the second recension). However, I
do not believe that they predated the formation of the study group.
Indeed, the existence of the case statements in written form makes
little sense outside the context of the study group. Rather, I think
that Gratian 0 developed them alongside the earliest group readings.

The fact that that the case statements were written by a single author
whose words appear nowhere else in the *Decretum*, that their existence
implies use by a reading or study group, and that almost no changes were
made to their text during the stages of the development of the
*Decretum* into which we have visibility, all suggest to me that the
process start quite early, likely in the 1120s and that the collection
of *dicta* as a whole therefore grew to its classical form over several
decades.

<!--

Why did Gratian 0 make no direct contribution to the text of the
*Decretum* other than the case statements or *themata*? I suspect
that it was because his written Latin was not as good as that of
other members of the study group. (See discussion in Chapter 3
*supra* of the use of reflexives in C.3 d.init. and C.29 d.init.)
I think it is natural to assume that Gratian was older than the
other members of the study group: teachers are, after all, usually
older than their students. Stipulating to Winroth's argument that
the Siena necrology indicates that Gratian died on 10 August 1144
or 1145 as bishop of Chiusi, and guessing that he was probably
around age 60 at the time of his death, means that Gratian would
have received the early Latin grammar-intensive portions of his
education before 1100. That may not have been enough to keep up
with his students as the standards of Latin composition rose as the
twelfth century advanced.

[As an aside, I think the anomalous Latin was what most convinced
Winroth that I was onto something after I told him that the case
statements were not written by the same author(s) who wrote the
first-recension *dicta*. He was non-committal the first time I
presented my results to him in 2013 or 2014, but at the Stephan
Kuttner Institute event at Yale in 2015 he told me he was convinced
because "ever since you pointed that out to me, I've noticed that
his Latin is just not that good."]

  -->

Moving beyond the exact wording of the first-recension case statements,
the real contribution of the figure later identified as Gratian to the
*Decretum* was as the leader of the study group, the thinker whose
method of reconciling the contradictions presented by the canons came to
be memorialized in the first-recension *dicta*. This was the second, and
probably more important, role that Gratian played in the development of
the text of the first recension. That is not to say that his methods,
arguments, and solutions were not worked out in the context of the study
group, but members of the group clearly accepted Gratian's method of
reconciling the canons as authoritative for them, and passed down to
later students of canon law the understanding that Gratian was the
author of the *Decretum* in the sense that it was his authority that lay
behind the particular reading of the canons the collection embodied.
Although the words of the *dicta* are demonstrably not his, the fact
that his name came to be attached to the text strongly suggests that the
method was his, and that is the basis for the authority claim made on
Gratian's behalf by the community the exponential growth of the original
study group ultimately created.

Gratian 0 continued to contribute to the work as long as the first
recension was under active development by the study group, which by the
mid-1130s had evolved into something looking more like a university
course, or even an informal network of courses: a proto-faculty. In
fact, the first recension can probably be safely (if circularly) defined
as that stage in the textual development of the *Decretum* in which
Gratian 0 was still personally involved. I think Winroth is right that
the person called Gratian was not a contributor to the second recension.

<!--

That is something of a non-answer, as it does not put an end-date
on Gratian's active involvement in the evolution of the text. He
could have remained involved until he got a benefice (possibly the
bishopric of Chiusi, c.1143), something he seems to have waited
rather longer for than many of the other early contributors to the
project. But the textual evolution of the first recension seems to
have been more or less complete by the mid-1130s, and, if we believe
Noonan and Grebner, Gratian was still acting as a legal consultant
into the early 1140s. That leaves a gap of a half-decade or so
(1136-1143?) when Gratian could have been, but does not seem to
actually have been, involved with the further evolution of the text.
I speculate that after the mid-1130s, deficiencies in Gratian's
knowledge of Roman law, at least relative to that of other younger
member of the loose proto-faculty, limited his further contributions
to the project in the same way that relative deficiencies in his
Latin skills had limited his contributions as author (as opposed
to authority) at earlier stages of the project.

  -->

Why were the contributors who followed Gratian all anonymous? The
larger-than-expected number of contributors and the apparent absence of
overlap between contributors to the first- and second-recension *dicta*
suggests that the involvement of individual contributors was relatively
brief, perhaps a year or two. As noted above, involvement in Gratian's
project would have to have conferred significant real-world advantages
for the contributors, in the form of enhanced competitiveness for
benefices, in order to justify the uncompensated scribal labor they put
into it. When ecclesiastical preferment came their way, their
involvement in Gratian's project probably ended. But the fact that they
had been successful attracted others to take their place, which goes a
long way toward explaining the exponential growth pattern.

The rapid turnover of contributors meant that the study group went
through several "generations" of members between the mid-1120s and
mid-1130s. By the time of Paucapalea in the late 1140s, turnover of
membership in what had by that point become a quite substantial
community was much slower, but there had been so many intervening
"generations" that any information about the history of the project that
had not been incorporated into the text of the *Decretum* was lost,
apparently including for Paucapalea even the name of Gratian.

What does all of this say about teachers and the teaching of canon law
between the early 1120s and the 1150s? In the 1120s and 1130s, the
distinction between teacher and student was much less clear than it
became a few decades later. Gratian was the leader of the study group,
and the figure to whom the group deferred, because he was the one who
had done by far, one suspects, the most reading in the sources of canon
law. But having read widely in the canons was not the same thing as
having fully worked out a jurisprudential system based on them, and
there was a great deal that Gratian did not know at that point, such as
whether and how to incorporate Roman law into his system. In some sense,
then, they were all figuring it out together. We should not think of the
Gratian of the 1120s as the kind of guild-certified master, able to
"explain it all for you," that we would expect to encounter in later
decades.

Although I am uncomfortable with using the terms teacher and student to
describe the relationship between Gratian and the contributors the early
stages of the project, I suspect that by the mid-1130s, we can envision
the ongoing activity around Gratian as having evolved from being a
reading or study group into something more like a course or even a loose
proto-faculty. Gratian need not have been the only teacher at this later
stage, and some of the early contributors, at least those still working
in Bologna while awaiting a suitable benefice, may well have had
students of their own by that point. As a result, some of the texts that
became part of the collection of *dicta* could have come from teachers
other than Gratian and some from students summarizing or reporting on
solutions presented by teachers in class room discussion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pennington has argued against Winroth's claim that the development from
the first to the second recension of the *Decretum* was accomplished in
a single bound by someone other than the original Gratian on the grounds
that someone would have noticed and remarked on such an extensive
revision of the text by another author,[2] and he could presumably make
a similar argument against my claim that there was a change in
authorship between the case statements and the first-recension *dicta*.

They did not notice or know, however, because the *Decretum* came to the
attention of a significant audience only among the second, not the
first, generation of jurists after Gratian. The earliest significant
change to the text to draw widespread notice was the division of the
first part of the *Decretum* into distinctions by Paucapalea.
Paucapalea, though, was far enough removed from the circumstances
surrounding the composition of the text that he does not appear even to
have known the name of its author. Ironically, Pennington's "someone
would have noticed" argument is wrong precisely because his argument
that the text of the *Decretum* underwent a long and slow process of
development is right.

<!--

This, in turn, is an argument in favor of the case statements having
been one of the first parts of the *Decretum* reduced to a stable
written form. The logical alternative, that case statements were
written after the fact, would have to have taken place late enough
in the development of the text that someone would have noticed.
