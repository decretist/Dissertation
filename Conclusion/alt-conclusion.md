The first, positive, result of the investigation presented in this
dissertation is the finding that the case statements or *themata*
were written by a single author whose words appear nowhere else in
the *Decretum*. The author of the case statements was *not* the
author of the first- or second-recension *dicta* or of the *dicta*
in *de Penitentia*. Following the convention established by Winroth,
who designated his hypothesized author of the second-recension
*dicta* as Gratian 2, I have named this single author of the case
statements Gratian 0, and I take him to be *the* historical Gratian.
That the case statements have a single author is not surprising,
but that they were not written by the author(s) of any of the
collections of *dicta* is quite unexpected. This finding is supported
both by the values for Burrows's Delta and the results of principal
component analysis.[^1] This result warrants a high degree of
confidence, and future conjectural *novelle* will have to account
for the fact that the case statements were not written by the author
of either the first- or second-recension *dicta*.

[^1]: Indeed, it is worth reminding the reader here that Burrows's
Delta indicates that the case statements are even less likely to
have been written by the same author as the *dicta* collections in
the *Decretum* than are the samples from the pseudo-Augustinian *De
vera et falsa penitentia* quoted by Gratian in *de Penitentia*.

The second, negative, result is that principal component analysis
(PCA) does not produce either of the two findings that might
reasonably be expected on the basis of recent scholarly debate over
the authorship of the *Decretum*. The PCA results do not show samples
from the first- and second-recension *dicta* forming a single tight
cluster in a way that would support Pennington's single-author
hypothesis. Neither do they show the samples from the first- and
second-recension *dicta* forming two distinct tight clusters
separating cleanly from each other in an unambiguously bimodal
distribution that would support Winroth's two-author hypothesis.
Any attempt to make an argument on the basis of the results of
principal component analysis in favor of either of the one- or
two-author hypotheses would be unpersuasive. Treating the *dicta*
from *de Penitentia* as a third collection separate and distinct
from the first- and second-recension *dicta* complicates the picture
further still. The most that we can say is that both the second-recension
*dicta* and the *dicta* from *de Penitentia* display some degree
of loose clustering, in that most samples from those collections
of *dicta* appear in the same quadrant, and that both display some
degree of partial separation from the first-recension *dicta*. These
results are not compatible either with there having been a single
author who wrote both the first- and second-recension *dicta* or
there having been a single author who wrote the first-recension
*dicta* for both *de Penitentia* and the rest of the *Decretum*.
This second negative finding does not warrant the same level of
confidence as the first positive result and represents a call for
further investigation.

The statement that Gratian is the author of the *Decretum* is a
convenient shorthand in which the *Decretum* as a whole stands
synecdochically for the *dicta*. Gratian scholars are in no danger
of being misled by this shorthand. But they are in danger of being
misled by the implied statement that Gratian is the author of the
*dicta*.

Scholarship on the *Decretum* in the aftermath of Noonan's debunking
of the traditional Gratian legendary and Winroth's discovery of the
first recension has taken for granted that either one or two authors
wrote the *dicta* and that either the same one author or the first
of the two authors (Gratian 1) wrote the case statements or *themata*.
When I started work on this project in 2013, I accepted that
assumption and fully expected stylometric results for the *dicta*
(including the case statements) to be consistent with either
Pennington's one-author hypothesis or Winroth's two-author hypothesis.
My intention was simply to expand what I perceived to be an
insufficient evidentiary basis for the debate over whether the
*dicta* had one or two authors. However, it became clear at a very
early stage of the project that the case statements, or *themata*,
were instead written by a single author whose words appear nowhere
else in the *Decretum*. Following Winroth, who refers to the
hypothesized author of the second-recension *dicta* as Gratian 2,
I named this figure Gratian 0, and I take him to be *the* historical
Gratian.

Contrary to expectation, none of the stylometric evidence produced
at any stage of the project was compatible with either the one- or
two-Gratian hypotheses for the authorship of the *dicta*, none of
which were written by Gratian 0. I became convinced that the
individual *dicta* have to be distinguished from the collection as
a whole and that it is not consistent with the stylometric evidence
to think of the collection as a work of literature with some internal
principle of unity written by either a single author or two authors.
The *dicta* are more coherent than a gloss collection but less
coherent than a treatise. What we have in the *dicta* is a collection
of texts and what we need is some idea of how that collection was
composed. Much of the post-Noonan scholarship on the authorship of
the *Decretum* has engaged in what I have referred to as a "quest
of the historical Gratian." However, it appears that to search for
one or more historical Gratians behind the collection of *dicta*
is to ask a question that is incapable of producing a meaningful
answer.

How are we then to make sense of these unexpected results?

The first questions to be answered about how the collection was
composed are where and when it came into existence. I see no reason
to call into question the scholarly consensus that the *Decretum*
emerged from the overlapping circles concerned with legal questions
in early twelfth-century Bologna. The traditional assumption that
Gratian worked in Bologna is almost the only feature of the Gratian
legendary that Noonan did not seriously challenge,[@noonan_gratian_1979,
162] and the development of Bologna as a center for the study of
Roman and, somewhat later, canon law clearly seems to have benefited
from the cluster effect so familiar in our age from the concentration
of technology industries in California's Silicon Valley and Route
128 in Boston.

That the case statements were both quite stable from an early stage
in the evolution of the text of the *Decretum* (only 13 words were
added, to C.19 d.init., in the second recension) and that they were
written by an author whose words appear in none of the later *dicta*
argues---strongly, I think---that the textual development of the
*Decretum* started early, perhaps in the mid-1120s, and that the
case statements were not written after the fact to scaffold
more-or-less finished treatments of the cases.

The *Marturi placitum* (1076) is evidence that the Roman law strand
of the legal revolution had a lengthy prehistory---the long tail
of a pattern of exponential growth in which for an extended period
the number of people involved was quite small---before it broke the
surface into historical visibility thirty years later in the first
decade of the twelfth century. For canon law, the results of the
collective efforts of the circle we associate with the name of
Gratian emerge into our field of view only after 1140. If the
development of canon law studies followed the same pattern of
long-tail exponential growth that the study of Roman law did, it
would not be unreasonable to posit that the circle around Gratian
had been at work in some form or another for more than a decade by
1140. (Pennington has argued for a long period of textual development
for the *Decretum*, while Winroth has argued that Roman and canon
law studies were nowhere near as fully developed by the end of the
1130s as previously thought. These arguments have been thought of
as being at odds, not least by Pennington and Winroth themselves,
but I prefer to think of them as intuitions, from different starting
points, of the same process of long-tail exponential growth, and,
therefore, in some sense both right.)

The textual stability and unique authorship of the case statements,
as well as the inferred analogy between the early pattern of growth
of the study of both Roman law and canon law, suggest then that
Gratian's project was in progress by the mid-1120s. If that tentative
dating is correct, it seems plausible to connect the beginnings of
Gratian's project with new understandings of the church as an
independent political and juridical community in the aftermath of
the Concordat of Worms (1122) and the First Lateran Council (1123),
with the circle around Gratian systematically working through the
implications of an epochal event for both the universal church and
the church in its local and particular institutional context.

<!--

The *dicta* display some locality of reference, i.e., a given
*dictum* is likely to discuss the same or a similar issue, and
presumably to have the same author, as the *dicta* immediately
before and after it.

The historical Gratian is often said to have created a collection
of canons that he used in the earliest course on canon law <!-- and
may also have written a few of the comments that are now part of
the collection of *dicta* --> but we must be extremely careful about
precisely what we mean when we say that Gratian "created a collection
of canons" and especially when we say that the collection was "used
in the earliest course on canon law."

I believe that it is reasonable to assume that the historical Gratian
was, when he initiated the project, someone who had carefully read
around a half-dozen important reform-era formal source collections.
He was aware in a general way of how the new schools in Northern
France approached textual problems, and in particular of the
hermeneutical approach to reading the canons outlined in Ivo's
*Prologue* but "left as an exercise to the reader." I think that
it is also important to note that one of the things Gratian brought
to the project from the outset was a fundamentally conservative and
optimistic disposition: his was the antithesis of Peter Abelard's
project of subverting and even dissolving the whole notion of
authority by showing that the authorities were in actual, not just
apparent, disagreement. (I think the depiction of Gratian smiling
in *Paradiso* 10.103 <!-- and in the 18th century engraving that
Winroth has popularized on the internet --> does actually capture
something significant about the optimistic outlook that he brought
to his engagement with the authorities.)

At some point in the mid-1120s, Gratian became the convener of a
study group that read the canons and started to work out a systematic
jurisprudence based on them. The formation of the study group was
obviously a crucial step in the development of canon law as a
discipline, but to call it "the earliest course on canon law" is
to anachronistically read as an inevitability the later evolution
of the circle into a school, then a faculty, then finally a university,
back into its earliest stage. I think we can infer that Gratian at
this point had a good command of the sources, but he was not yet
in possession of a fully developed method for reconciling the
contradictions presented by the canons that he could systematically
impart to students. He did not at this stage know so much more than
the other participants in the study group that we can unambiguously
call him *magister* and them *discipuli*.

One of the most important things the formation of the study group
did for Gratian was to provide him with a pool of volunteer labor
that made it possible to put on parchment the collection of canons
he thought raised the really salient issues and his comments on
them. Before the formation of the study group, I doubt that the
collection of canons and comments had any concrete existence outside
of Gratian's mind. Although Gratian 0 was the author in the literal
sense of having formulated the exact working of the 3,592 words of
the first-recension case statements, I do not believe that they
predated the formation of the study group. Indeed, the existence
of the case statements in written form makes little sense outside
the context of the work of the study group. Rather, I think that
Gratian developed them alongside the earliest group readings.
