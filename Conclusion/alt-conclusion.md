The first, positive, result of the investigation presented in this
dissertation is the finding that the case statements or *themata*
were written by a single author whose words appear nowhere else in
the *Decretum*. The author of the case statements was *not* the
author of the first- or second-recension *dicta* or of the *dicta*
in *de Penitentia*. Following the convention established by Winroth,
who designated his hypothesized author of the second-recension
*dicta* as Gratian 2, I have named this single author of the case
statements Gratian 0, and I take him to be *the* historical Gratian.
That the case statements have a single author is not surprising,
but that they were not written by the author(s) of any of the
collections of *dicta* is quite unexpected. This finding is supported
both by the values for Burrows's Delta and the results of principal
component analysis.[^1] This result warrants a high degree of
confidence, and future conjectural *novelle* will have to account
for the fact that the case statements were not written by the author
of either the first- or second-recension *dicta*.

[^1]: Indeed, it is worth reminding the reader here that Burrows's
Delta indicates that the case statements are even less likely to
have been written by the same author as the *dicta* collections in
the *Decretum* than are the samples from the pseudo-Augustinian *De
vera et falsa penitentia* quoted by Gratian in *de Penitentia*.

The second, negative, result is that principal component analysis
(PCA) does not produce either of the two findings that might
reasonably be expected on the basis of recent scholarly debate over
the authorship of the *Decretum*. The PCA results do not show samples
from the first- and second-recension *dicta* forming a single tight
cluster in a way that would support Pennington's single-author
hypothesis. Neither do they show the samples from the first- and
second-recension *dicta* forming two distinct tight clusters
separating cleanly from each other in an unambiguously bimodal
distribution that would support Winroth's two-author hypothesis.
Any attempt to make an argument on the basis of the results of
principal component analysis in favor of either of the one- or
two-author hypotheses would be unpersuasive. Treating the *dicta*
from *de Penitentia* as a third collection separate and distinct
from the first- and second-recension *dicta* complicates the picture
further still. The most that we can say is that both the second-recension
*dicta* and the *dicta* from *de Penitentia* display some degree
of loose clustering, in that most samples from those collections of
*dicta* appear in the same quadrant, and that both display some
degree of partial separation from the first-recension *dicta*. These
results are not compatible either with there having been a single
author who wrote both the first- and second-recension *dicta* or
there having been a single author who wrote the first-recension
*dicta* for both *de Penitentia* and the rest of the *Decretum*.
This second negative finding does not warrant the same level of
confidence as the first positive result and represents a call for
further investigation.
