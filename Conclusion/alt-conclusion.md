The first, positive, result of the investigation presented in this
dissertation is the finding that the case statements or *themata*
were written by a single author whose words appear nowhere else in
the *Decretum*. The author of the case statements was *not* the
author of the first- or second-recension *dicta* or of the *dicta*
in *de Penitentia*. I have designated this single author of the
case statements Gratian 0 to distinguish him from Gratian 1 and
Gratian 2, the authors of the first- and second-recension *dicta*
hypothesized by Winroth, and I take him to be *the* historical
Gratian. That the case statements have a single author is not
surprising, but that they were not written by the author(s) of any
of the collections of *dicta* is quite unexpected. This finding is
supported both by the values for Burrows's Delta and the results
of principal component analysis.[^1] This result warrants a high
degree of confidence, and future conjectural *novelle* will have
to account for the fact that the case statements were not written
by the author of either the first- or second-recension *dicta*.

The second, negative, result is that principal component analysis
(PCA) does not produce either of the two findings that might
reasonably be expected on the basis of recent scholarly debate over
the authorship of the *Decretum*. The PCA results do not show samples
from the first- and second-recension *dicta* forming a single tight
cluster in a way that would support Pennington's single-author
hypothesis. Neither do they show the samples from the first- and
second-recension *dicta* forming two distinct tight clusters
separating cleanly from each other in an unambiguously bimodal
distribution that would support Winroth's two-author hypothesis.
Any attempt to make an argument on the basis of the results of
principal component analysis in favor of either of the one- or
two-author hypotheses would be unpersuasive. Treating the *dicta*
from *de Penitentia* as a third collection separate and distinct
from the first- and second-recension *dicta* complicates the picture
further still. The most that we can say is that both the second-recension
*dicta* and the *dicta* from *de Penitentia* display some degree
of loose clustering, in that most samples from those collections
of *dicta* appear in the same quadrant, and that both display some
degree of partial separation from the first-recension *dicta*. These
results are not compatible either with there having been a single
author who wrote both the first- and second-recension *dicta* or
there having been a single author who wrote the first-recension
*dicta* for both *de Penitentia* and the rest of the *Decretum*.
This second negative finding does not warrant the same level of
confidence as the first positive result and represents a call for
further investigation.

The statement that Gratian is the author of the *Decretum* is a
convenient shorthand in which the *Decretum* as a whole stands
synecdochically for the *dicta*. Gratian scholars are in no danger
of being misled by this shorthand. But they are in danger of being
misled by the implied statement that Gratian is the author of the
*dicta*.

Scholarship on the *Decretum* in the aftermath of Noonan's debunking
of the traditional Gratian legendary and Winroth's discovery of the
first recension has taken for granted that either one or two authors
wrote the *dicta* and that either the same one author or the first
of the two authors (Gratian 1) wrote the case statements or *themata*.
When I started work on this project in 2013, I accepted that
assumption and fully expected stylometric results for the *dicta*
(including the case statements) to be consistent with either
Pennington's one-author hypothesis or Winroth's two-author hypothesis.
My intention was simply to expand what I perceived to be an
insufficient evidentiary basis for the debate over whether the
*dicta* had one or two authors. However, it became clear at a very
early stage of the project that the case statements, or *themata*,
were instead written by a single author (Gratian 0) whose words
appear nowhere else in the *Decretum*.

Contrary to expectation, none of the stylometric evidence produced
at any stage of the project was compatible with either the one- or
two-Gratian hypotheses for the authorship of the *dicta*, none of
which were written by Gratian 0. I became convinced that the
individual *dicta* have to be distinguished from the collection as
a whole and that it is not consistent with the stylometric evidence
to think of the collection as a work of literature with some internal
principle of unity written by either a single author or two authors.
The *dicta* are more coherent than a gloss collection but less
coherent than a treatise. What we have in the *dicta* is a collection
of texts and what we need is some idea of how that collection was
composed. Much of the post-Noonan scholarship on the authorship of
the *Decretum* has engaged in what I have referred to as a "quest
of the historical Gratian." However, it appears that to search for
one or more historical Gratians behind the collection of *dicta*
is to ask a question that is incapable of producing a meaningful
answer.

How are we then to make sense of these unexpected results?

The first questions to be answered about how the collection was
composed are where and when it came into existence. I see no reason
to call into question the scholarly consensus that the *Decretum*
emerged from the overlapping circles concerned with legal questions
in early twelfth-century Bologna. The traditional assumption that
Gratian worked in Bologna is almost the only feature of the Gratian
legendary that Noonan did not seriously challenge,[@noonan_gratian_1979,
162] and the development of Bologna as a center for the study of
Roman and, somewhat later, canon law clearly seems to have benefited
from the cluster effect so familiar in our age from the concentration
of technology industries in California's Silicon Valley and Route
128 in Boston.

That the case statements were both quite stable from an early stage
in the evolution of the text of the *Decretum* (only 13 words were
added, to C.19 d.init., in the second recension) and that they were
written by an author whose words appear in none of the later *dicta*
argues---strongly, I think---that the textual development of the
*Decretum* started early, perhaps in the mid-1120s, and that the
case statements were not written after the fact to scaffold
more-or-less finished treatments of the cases.

The *Marturi placitum* (1076) is evidence that the Roman law strand
of the legal revolution had a lengthy prehistory---the long tail
of a pattern of exponential growth in which for an extended period
the number of people involved was quite small---before it broke the
surface into historical visibility thirty years later in the first
decade of the twelfth century. For canon law, the results of the
collective efforts of the circle we associate with the name of
Gratian emerge into our field of view only after 1140. If the
development of canon law studies followed the same pattern of
long-tail exponential growth that the study of Roman law did, it
would not be unreasonable to posit that the circle around Gratian
had been at work in some form or another for more than a decade by
1140. (Pennington has argued for a long period of textual development
for the *Decretum*, while Winroth has argued that Roman and canon
law studies were nowhere near as fully developed by the end of the
1130s as previously thought. These arguments have been thought of
as being at odds, not least by Pennington and Winroth themselves,
but I prefer to think of them as intuitions, from different starting
points, of the same process of long-tail exponential growth, and,
therefore, in some sense both right.)

The textual stability and unique authorship of the case statements,
as well as the inferred analogy between the early pattern of growth
of the study of both Roman law and canon law, suggest then that
Gratian's project was in progress by the mid-1120s. If that tentative
dating is correct, it seems plausible to connect the beginnings of
Gratian's project with new understandings of the church as an
independent political and juridical community in the aftermath of
the Concordat of Worms (1122) and the First Lateran Council (1123),
with the circle around Gratian systematically working through the
implications of an epochal event for both the universal church and
the church in its local and particular institutional context.

The *dicta* display some locality of reference, i.e., a given

presumably to have the same author, as the *dicta* immediately
before and after it.

The historical Gratian is often said to have created a collection
of canons that he used in the earliest course on canon law <!-- and
may also have written a few of the comments that are now part of
the collection of *dicta* --> but we must be extremely careful about
precisely what we mean when we say that Gratian "created a collection
of canons" and especially when we say that the collection was "used
in the earliest course on canon law."

I believe that it is reasonable to assume that the historical Gratian
was, when he initiated the project, someone who had carefully read
around a half-dozen important reform-era formal source collections.
He was aware in a general way of how the new schools in Northern
France approached textual problems, and in particular of the
hermeneutical approach to reading the canons outlined in Ivo's
*Prologue* but "left as an exercise to the reader." I think that
it is also important to note that one of the things Gratian brought
to the project from the outset was a fundamentally conservative and
optimistic disposition: his was the antithesis of Peter Abelard's
project of subverting and even dissolving the whole notion of
authority by showing that the authorities were in actual, not just
apparent, disagreement. (I think the depiction of Gratian smiling
in *Paradiso* 10.103 <!-- and in the 18th century engraving that
Winroth has popularized on the internet --> does actually capture
something significant about the optimistic outlook that he brought
to his engagement with the authorities.)

At some point in the mid-1120s, Gratian became the convener of a
study group that read the canons and started to work out a systematic
jurisprudence based on them. The formation of the study group was
obviously a crucial step in the development of canon law as a
discipline, but to call it "the earliest course on canon law" is
to anachronistically read as an inevitability the later evolution
of the circle into a school, then a faculty, then finally a university,
back into its earliest stage. I think we can infer that Gratian at
this point had a good command of the sources, but he was not yet
in possession of a fully developed method for reconciling the
contradictions presented by the canons that he could systematically
impart to students. He did not at this stage know so much more than
the other participants in the study group that we can unambiguously
call him *magister* and them *discipuli*.

One of the most important things the formation of the study group
did for Gratian was to provide him with a pool of volunteer labor
that made it possible to put on parchment the collection of canons
he thought raised the really salient issues and his comments on
them. Before the formation of the study group, I doubt that the
collection of canons and comments had any concrete existence outside
of Gratian's mind. In particular, I do not believe that case
statements predated the formation of the study group. Indeed, the
existence of the case statements in written form makes little sense
outside the context of the work of the study group. Rather, I think
that Gratian developed them alongside the earliest group readings.

The person later identified as Gratian performed two distinct roles
in the evolution of the text of the first recension, as author and
as authority. Gratian 0 appears to be the author of the 3,592 words
of the first-recension case statements or *themata* in the literal
sense of having formulated their exact wording. The case statements
were Gratian 0's only direct contribution to the text of the
*Decretum*, and his authorial signature appears nowhere else in the
corpus of *dicta*. Unlike Winroth's Gratian 1 and Gratian 2, Gratian
0 is clearly one person. The facts that that the case statements
were written by a single author whose words appear nowhere else in
the *Decretum*, that their existence implies use by a reading or
study group, and that almost no changes were made to their wording
during the stages of the development of the *Decretum* into which
we have any visibility, all support, in my opinion, arguments that
the development of the text likely started in the mid-1120s and
that the collection of *dicta* as a whole grew to its classical
form over several decades.

<!--

Why did Gratian 0 make no direct contribution to the text of the
*Decretum* other than the case statements or *themata*? I suspect
that it was because his written Latin was not as good as that of
other members of the study group. (See discussion in Chapter 3
*supra* of the use of reflexives in C.3 d.init. and C.29 d.init.)
I think it is natural to assume that Gratian was older than the
other members of the study group: teachers are, after all, usually
older than their students. Stipulating to Winroth's argument that
the Siena necrology indicates that Gratian died on 10 August 1144
or 1145 as bishop of Chiusi, and guessing that he was probably
around age 60 at the time of his death, means that Gratian would
have received the early Latin grammar-intensive portions of his
education before 1100. That may not have been enough to keep up
with his students as the standards of Latin composition rose as the
twelfth century advanced.

[As an aside, I think the anomalous Latin was what most convinced
Winroth that I was onto something after I told him that the case
statements were not written by the same author(s) who wrote the
first-recension *dicta*. He was non-committal the first time I
presented my results to him in 2013 or 2014, but at the Stephan
Kuttner Institute event at Yale in 2015 he told me he was convinced
because "ever since you pointed that out to me, I've noticed that
his Latin is just not that good."]

Moving beyond the exact wording of the first-recension case statements,
the second, and probably more significant, contribution made by the
figure later identified as Gratian to the development of the
*Decretum* was as the leader of the study group. It was Gratian's
method of using hypothetical cases as a framework for applying the
hermeneutical principles proposed in Ivo's *Prologue* for reconciling
the contradictions presented by the canons that came to be memorialized
in the first-recension *dicta*. This is not to say that his methods,
arguments, and solutions were not worked out in the context of the
study group, but they were worked out under his guidance and in
accordance with his program. Members of the group clearly accepted
Gratian's method of reconciling the canons as authoritative for
them, and passed down to later students of canon law the understanding
that Gratian was the author of the *Decretum* in the sense that it
was his authority that lay behind the particular reading of the
canons the collection embodied. Although the words of the *dicta*
are demonstrably not his, the fact that his name came to be attached
to the text strongly suggests that the method was his, and that is
the basis for the authority claim made on Gratian's behalf by the
community the exponential growth of the original study group
ultimately created.

Gratian 0 continued to contribute to the work as long as the first
recension was under active development by the study group, which
by the mid-1130s had evolved into something looking more like a
university course, or even an informal network of courses: a
proto-faculty. In fact, the first recension can probably be safely
(if circularly) defined as that stage in the textual development
of the *Decretum* which Gratian 0 still personally guided. I think
Winroth is right that the person called Gratian was not a contributor
to the second recension.

<!--

That is something of a non-answer, as it does not put an end-date
on Gratian's active involvement in the evolution of the text. He
could have remained involved until he got a benefice (possibly the
bishopric of Chiusi, c.1143), something he seems to have waited
rather longer for than many of the other early contributors to the
project. But the textual evolution of the first recension seems to
have been more or less complete by the mid-1130s, and, if we believe
Noonan and Grebner, Gratian was still acting as a legal consultant
into the early 1140s. That leaves a gap of a half-decade or so
(1136-1143?) when Gratian could have been, but does not seem to
actually have been, involved with the further evolution of the text.
I speculate that after the mid-1130s, deficiencies in Gratian's
knowledge of Roman law, at least relative to that of other younger
member of the loose proto-faculty, limited his further contributions
to the project in the same way that relative deficiencies in his
Latin skills had limited his contributions as author (as opposed
to authority) at earlier stages of the project.

[^1]: Indeed, it is worth reminding the reader here that Burrows's
Delta indicates that the case statements are even less likely to
have been written by the same author as the *dicta* collections in
the *Decretum* than are the samples from the pseudo-Augustinian *De
vera et falsa penitentia* quoted by Gratian in *de Penitentia*.
