### De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)

The manuscript of *De Doctrina Christiana* was discovered in November
1823 by Robert Lemon the elder, Deputy Keeper of His Majesty's State
Papers in a 'press' (cupboard) in the Old State Paper Office in the
Middle Treasury Gallery in Whitehall.[^1] The manuscript was
attributed by Lemon to Milton.[^2] The discovery and attribution
of the manuscript generated enough public interest that Home Secretary
Robert Peel was asked, and answered, questions about the printing
arrangements in the House of Commons in March 1824 [@campbell_milton_2007,
1, 5]. The attribution was challenged by William Hunter in 1991.
