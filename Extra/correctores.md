## *Correctores Romani* edition (1582)

The *Decretum* never received the kind of formal ecclesiastical (papal
or conciliar) recognition that was conferred on decretal collections
like the *Liber Extra*, *Liber Sextus*, and *Clementinae*. Nevertheless,
it remained foundational both to the *Corpus Iuris Canonici*, the body
of canon law that governed the Roman Catholic Church right up until
1917, as well as to the academic study of canon law throughout the
medieval and well into the early modern periods. As a result, the text
of the *Decretum* came in for close attention as part of the reform
program initiated at the Council of Trent (1545-1563). A commission led
by the Spanish archbishop Antonio Agustín (1517-1586), the *Correctores*
*Romani*, was charged with producing an approved version of the text of
the *Decretum* (along with the rest of the *Corpus* *Iuris* *Canonici*)
for the age of the printing press.

The *Correctores *proceeded from the Renaissance Humanist assumption
that their job was to identify and include the most textually correct
version of the material source for each of Gratian's authorities. In
this sense the *Correctores* were less concerned with getting at the
text of the collection Gratian actually compiled, and more concerned
with getting at the text that they thought Gratian should have compiled,
if his concerns had been those of a Renaissance philological
scholar.[^1]

The 1582 printed edition of the *Decretum* includes the ordinary gloss,
the standardized commentary by [Johannes
Teutonicus](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a303) (c.1170--1245)
in 1216, which was revised and updated by [Bartholomeus
Brixiensis](http://amesfoundation.law.harvard.edu/BioBibCanonists/Report_Biobib2.php?record_id=a050) (fl.1234--1258)
around 1240-1245. UCLA's online version of the [Corpus Iuris Canonici
(1582)](http://digital.library.ucla.edu/canonlaw/) is a convenient way
for modern scholars to consult the ordinary gloss, which is an important
tool for understanding the reception of Gratian's text by medieval
jurists.

[^1]: The idea that the *Correctores* were trying to reproduce the text
    of the *Decretum* as they though Gratian should have written it, as
    opposed to the text as he actually wrote it, goes back at least as
    far as Friedberg: "Vides non id in animo habuisse correctores
    Romanos, ut restitueretur decretum, quale a Gratiano compositum
    esset, sed quale a Gratiano componi debuisset." ("You see it in the
    mind that the *Correctores Romani* had, as the *Decretum* was
    restored, not how it was composed by Gratian, but how it ought to
    have been composed by Gratian." trans. PLE) (edF 1.lxxviii, see also
