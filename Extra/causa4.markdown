### Sg translation:

Someone was excommunicated and arranges to accuse a bishop; he brings in
an adolescent under 14 years for the purpose of asserting the case with
him. Who, when he is prohibited from accusation, makes himself a witness
and the minor the accuser;[1] but the minor wishes to perform the role
of \[both\] accuser and witness. On the appointed day, the bishop does
not come to court \[and\] is suspended from communion. After the court
reconvened again,[2] the accuser is found \[to be\] at fault in
\[bringing\] the accusation. Finally, he proceeds to the assertion of
his own case. It is asked therefore first whether an excommunicate can
accuse another? Second, whether someone (*quis*) under 14 years is able
to testify in a criminal case? Third, whether someone (*quis*)
prohibited from accusation can assume the part of testifying? Fourth,
whether the same person can be \[both\] accuser and witness? Fifth,
whether someone (*quis*) not coming on the predetermined (*praestituta*)
day ought to be excommunicated, that is, deprived of communion? Sixth,
if someone (*quis*) found \[to be\] at fault in the episcopal court
ought to be further (*amplius*) admitted to the assertion of his own
case?

One of the apparent contrasts between the Sg and vulgate (Fr.) versions
of C.4 d.init. is in their use of legal technical terms. The refusal of
the accused bishop to appear before the court on the appointed day,
presumably because he does not recognize its authority to try a case
arising from an improper accusation, is described in the Sg version
using everyday language: "*episcopus ad iudicium non venit* (the bishop
does not come to court)." Similarly in the fifth question arising out of
his refusal: "*an quis non veniens die praestituta excommunicari debeat*
(whether someone not coming on the predetermined day ought to be
excommunicated)." The vulgate (Fr.) version of C.4 d.init., however,
uses *minime occurrit* in place of *non venit* and *occurrens* in the
place of *veniens* in a way that presumes that *minime occurrit* is a
legal technical term with almost precisely the same meaning we use today
when we say that a criminal defendant has been cited for failure to
appear in court.[3][4]

Excommunication is discussed in the Sg version of C.4 d.init. in a way
that indicates that the concept is not an entirely settled one. On the
one hand, the phrase *in excommunione constitutus* seems to be used in
the Sg text of the case statement as a legal technical term: someone,
like the accuser, who is said to be *in excommunione constitutus* seems
to have been permanently excommunicated, while the accused bishop is
said to have been *suspenditur a communione* (suspended from communion),
by implication only temporarily, for his failure to appear in court. On
the other hand, the Sg version of the case statement takes care to
define excommunication: "id est a communicatione privari (that is, to be
deprived of communion)", something the composer of the vulgate (Fr.)
version of the case statement does not find necessary.

The Sg version of C.4 d.init. uses the present tense, possibly intended
to be understood as historical present, consistently throughout the case
statement.

"After **sī**, **nisī**, **num**, and **nē**, all the **ali-**'s drop
away." Moreland and Fleischer, 217. See also Gildersleeve and Lodge,
§107; Allen and Greenough, §310a.

> disponit; adolescentem infra decimum et quartum etatis suae annum ad
> assertionem suae causae adducit; prohibitus ab accusatione

> accusatoris et testis gerere cupit; die statuta ad electorum iudicum
> iudicium episcopus minime occurrit; a communione suspenditur; tandem
> renouato iudicio accusator culpabilis in accusatione inuenitur; demum
> ad assertionem propriae causae procedit. Hic primum queritur, an in

> die constituta non occurrens a communione **ait** remouendus? Sexto,
> si in episcoporum **indicio** accusatoris persona culpabilis inuenta
> fuerit, an ad assertionem propriae causae de cetero sit admittenda?

The MGH e-text edited by Reuter and Silagi introduced the OCR errors
**ait** into the text of the fifth question (*Quinto, an die constituta
non occurrens a communione **ait** remouendus?*) and **indicio** into
the text of the sixth question (*Sexto, si in episcoporum **indicio**
accusatoris persona culpabilis inuenta fuerit ...*). The printed version
of Friedberg correctly reads *a communione **sit** remouendus* and *in
episcoporum **iudicio***.

### AaBcP text:

Quidam in excommunicatione constitutus episcopum accusare disponit;
adolescentem infra xiiiium etatis sue annum ad assertionem sue cause
adducit. Prohibitus ab accusatione adolescentem accusatorem et se testem
facit. Adolescens personam accusatoris et testis gerere cupit; die
statuta ad iudicium electorum iudicum episcopus minime concurrit; a
communione suspenditur; tandem renouato iudicio accusator culpabilis in
accusatione inuenitur; demum ad assertionem proprie cause procedit. Hic
primum queritur, an in excommunicatione constitutus alium accusare
ualeat? Secundo, an infra xiiiium annum in criminali causa testari quis
possit? Tercio, utrum ab accusatione prohibitus personam testificantis
possit assumere? Quarto, an idem possit esse accusator et testis?
Quinto, an die constituta non occurrens a communione sit remouendus?
Sexto, si in episcoporum iudicio accusatoris persona culpabilis inuenta
fuerit, an ad assertionem proprie cause de cetero sit admittenda?

[1] Reading here as *accusatorem*; presumably as a result of scribal
error, Sg reads *accusatore*.

[2] *lit*. "the court having been renewed again".

[3] There is also a literary precedent for translating the somewhat
opaque phrase *minime occurit* as "does not appear" in the commentary of
Maurus Servius Honoratus on Virgil: "*aut audire quod non dicitur,
videre quod minime occurrit* (or to hear what is not spoken, to see what
does not appear)". **Add reference to critical edition of Servius.**

[4] AaBcFdP reads *minime concurrit* rather than *minime occurrit*. It
is not clear whether this variant is meaningful, or whether it simply
perpetuates an error introduced into the hypothesized α hyparchetype
from which all first-recension manuscripts are now thought to have been
derived. **Add reference to Winroth article.**
