### Sg translation:

Someone was excommunicated and arranges to accuse a bishop; he
brings in an adolescent under 14 years for the purpose of asserting
the case with him. Who, when he is prohibited from accusation, makes
himself a witness and the minor the accuser;[^4] but the minor
wishes to perform the role of [both] accuser and witness. On the
appointed day, the bishop does not come to court [and] is suspended
from communion. After the court reconvened again,[^5] the accuser
is found [to be] at fault in [bringing] the accusation. Finally,
he proceeds to the assertion of his own case. It is asked therefore
first whether an excommunicate can accuse another? Second, whether
someone (_quis_) under 14 years is able to testify in a criminal
case? Third, whether someone (_quis_) prohibited from accusation
can assume the part of testifying? Fourth, whether the same person
can be [both] accuser and witness? Fifth, whether someone (_quis_)
not coming on the predetermined (_praestituta_) day ought to be
excommunicated, that is, deprived of communion? Sixth, if someone
(_quis_) found [to be] at fault in the episcopal court ought to be
further (_amplius_) admitted to the assertion of his own case?

[^4]: Reading here as _accusatorem_; presumably as a result of
scribal error, Sg reads _accusatore_.

[^5]: _lit_. "the court having been renewed again".

One of the apparent contrasts between the Sg and vulgate (Fr.)
versions of C.4 d.init. is in their use of legal technical terms.
The refusal of the accused bishop to appear before the court on the
appointed day, presumably because he does not recognize its authority
to try a case arising from an improper accusation, is described in
the Sg version using everyday language: "_episcopus ad iudicium non
venit_ (the bishop does not come to court)." Similarly in the fifth
question arising out of his refusal: "_an quis non veniens die
praestituta excommunicari debeat_ (whether someone not coming on
the predetermined day ought to be excommunicated)." The vulgate
(Fr.) version of C.4 d.init., however, uses _minime occurrit_ in
place of _non venit_ and _occurrens_ in the place of _veniens_ in
a way that presumes that _minime occurrit_ is a legal technical
term with almost precisely the same meaning we use today when we
say that a criminal defendant has been cited for failure to appear
in court.[^6][^7]

[^6]: There is also a literary precedent for translating the somewhat
opaque phrase _minime occurit_ as "does not appear" in the commentary
of Maurus Servius Honoratus on Virgil: "_aut audire quod non dicitur,
videre quod minime occurrit_ (or to hear what is not spoken, to see
what does not appear)". **Add reference to critical edition of
Servius.**

[^7]: AaBcFdP reads _minime concurrit_ rather than _minime occurrit_.
It is not clear whether this variant is meaningful, or whether it
simply perpetuates an error introduced into the hypothesized α
hyparchetype from which all first-recension manuscripts are now
thought to have been derived. **Add reference to Winroth article.**

Excommunication is discussed in the Sg version of C.4 d.init. in a
way that indicates that the concept is not an entirely settled one.
On the one hand, the phrase _in excommunione constitutus_ seems to
be used in the Sg text of the case statement as a legal technical
term: someone, like the accuser, who is said to be _in excommunione
constitutus_ seems to have been permanently excommunicated, while
the accused bishop is said to have been _suspenditur a communione_
(suspended from communion), by implication only temporarily, for
his failure to appear in court. On the other hand, the Sg version
of the case statement takes care to define excommunication: "id est
a communicatione privari (that is, to be deprived of communion)",
something the composer of the vulgate (Fr.) version of the case
statement does not find necessary.

The Sg version of C.4 d.init. uses the present tense, possibly
intended to be understood as historical present, consistently
throughout the case statement.

"After **sī**, **nisī**, **num**, and **nē**, all the **ali-**'s
drop away." Moreland and Fleischer, 217. See also Gildersleeve and
Lodge, §107; Allen and Greenough, §310a.

### Fr. text:

> (Fr. 536) Quidam in excommunicatione constitutus episcopum accusare
> disponit; adolescentem infra decimum et quartum etatis suae annum
> ad assertionem suae causae adducit; prohibitus ab accusatione
> adolescentem accusatorem et se testem facit; adolescens personam
> accusatoris et testis gerere cupit; die statuta ad electorum iudicum
> iudicium episcopus minime occurrit; a communione suspenditur; tandem
> renouato iudicio accusator culpabilis in accusatione inuenitur;
> demum ad assertionem propriae causae procedit. Hic primum queritur,
> an in excommunicatione constitutus alium accusare ualeat? Secundo,
> an infra decimum quartum annum in criminali causa testari quis
> possit? Tertio, utrum ab accusatione prohibitus personam testificantis
> possit assumere? Quarto, an idem possit esse accusator et testis?
> Quinto, an die constituta non occurrens a communione **ait** remouendus?
> Sexto, si in episcoporum **indicio** accusatoris persona culpabilis
> inuenta fuerit, an ad assertionem propriae causae de cetero sit
> admittenda?

The MGH e-text edited by Reuter and Silagi introduced the OCR errors
**ait** into the text of the fifth question (_Quinto, an die
constituta non occurrens a communione **ait** remouendus?_) and
**indicio** into the text of the sixth question (_Sexto, si in
episcoporum **indicio** accusatoris persona culpabilis inuenta
fuerit ..._). The printed version of Friedberg correctly reads _a
communione **sit** remouendus_ and _in episcoporum **iudicio**_.

### Fr. translation:

> Someone permanently excommunicated (_in excommunicatione constitutus_)
> arranges to accuse a bishop; he brings in (_adducit_) an adolescent
> under fourteen years of age to the assertion (t.t.) of his case;
> prohibited from accusation, he make the adolescent the accuser and
> himself the witness; the adolescent wishes to conduct/perform
> (_gerere_) the role (_personam_) of [both] accuser and witness; on
> the appointed day, the bishop does not appear before (_lit._ to)
> the court of the judge-electors; he is suspended from communion;
> at last, after the court reconvened [_lit._ the court having been
> renewed], the accuser is found [to be] at fault in [bringing] the
> accusation; finally he proceeds to the assertion (t.t.) of his own
> case.

### AaBcP text:

Quidam in excommunicatione constitutus episcopum accusare disponit;
adolescentem infra xiiiium etatis sue annum ad assertionem sue cause
adducit. Prohibitus ab accusatione adolescentem accusatorem et se
testem facit. Adolescens personam accusatoris et testis gerere
cupit; die statuta ad iudicium electorum iudicum episcopus minime
concurrit; a communione suspenditur; tandem renouato iudicio accusator
culpabilis in accusatione inuenitur; demum ad assertionem proprie

alium accusare ualeat? Secundo, an infra xiiiium annum in criminali
causa testari quis possit? Tercio, utrum ab accusatione prohibitus
personam testificantis possit assumere? Quarto, an idem possit esse
accusator et testis? Quinto, an die constituta non occurrens a
