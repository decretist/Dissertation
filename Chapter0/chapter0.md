## Prologue

The purpose of the following short introduction is to indicate the
importance of Gratian's *Decretum,* and to contextualize the
composition of the *Decretum* within the broader twelfth-century
revolution in legal science.

The *Decretum* is *not* the kind of document, like the Fournier
Register, the record of an episcopal inquisition into Albigensian
heretics surviving in a single manuscript, that many non-specialists,
with a journalistic eye for the exotic and the extreme, take to be
the central concern of medieval studies.[^1] The *Decretum* was,
instead, both a normal and a normative text in its own time, and
for centuries thereafter. The *Decretum* survives in an unusually
large number of manuscripts -- around 150-200 from the twelfth
century and around 600 for the medieval period overall.[^2] The
*Decretum* was the fundamental textbook for first-year university
instruction in canon law through the seventeenth century. As the
first volume of the *Corpus iuris canonici*, the *Decretum* remained
valid law in the Roman Catholic Church right up until 1917, and
exercised enormous influence over the 1917 and 1983 codifications
of canon law that replaced the old *Corpus*. The relevance of the
*Decretum* extends to everyday contemporary life. It is quite common
for twenty-first century American Roman Catholics to have had some
experience with diocesan marriage tribunals and the marriage annulment
process (for example, my wife once had to submit written testimony
to a diocesan marriage tribunal in support of her sister's petition
to have her first marriage annulled). When they come into contact
with the marriage annulment process, contemporaries become participants
in a legal system that, at least in its conceptual outlines, was
first systematized by Gratian in cases 27-36 in Part II of the
*Decretum*, the so-called marriage *causae*.
