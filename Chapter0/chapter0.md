## Introduction

Genesis of the project or: How I came to write a PhD dissertation
about an unexpected finding I wasn't looking for.

The most significant finding of the following dissertation is that
the author who wrote the thirty-six case statements introducing the
hypothetical cases that make up the second part of Gratian's
*Decretum* is very unlikely to have been the same person as the
author who wrote the *dicta* in the first recension of the *Decretum*.
I did not start work on this project thinking of the authorship of
the case statements as a research problem in any way. I assumed
that by definition the author of the case statements was one and
the same person as the author of the first-recension (R1) *dicta*.[^1]

I worked in information technology as a system administrator and
manager for most of the twenty-three years after graduating from
UC San Diego in 1984 with an undergraduate degree in History.
Stanley Chodorow had been the advisor for my undergraduate senior
thesis on the role of the cardinals in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. I was therefore aware of Gratian's *Decretum* in a general
sort of way, although the only use I made of it in connection with
that project was to consult the Latin text of Nicholas II's 1059
decree on papal elections (D.23 c.1). Stan's encouraging me to use
computer-aided typesetting for my thesis, a skill so unusual in
those years before consumer PCs were available as to verge on the
exotic, led directly to my IT career. In the mid to late 80s I went
on to take most of the required courses for the undergraduate
Computer Science major at UC San Diego (e.g., Data Structures,
Compiler Construction, Operating Systems) although I did not enroll
in a degree program. During my professional career, I was never
primarily a programmer, but from time to time my job responsibilities
did include programming projects in C and Perl, and ultimately Java
servlet-based web applications.

## Note on Translations

I have, wherever possible, supplied for each Latin passage quoted
the corresponding passage from a published English translation.[^2]
In cases where no such translation was available, or I considered
the available translation seriously misleading, I have supplied my
own translation, indicated with the notation **(trans. PLE)**.
**Acknowledge Atria A. Larson.**

[^1]: To the extent that there is some one person we can point to
as corresponding to our idea of "Gratian," it's the author of the
first-recension dicta. "The *dicta* in Gratian's *Decretum* bring
the reader closer to its author than any other part of the text."
[@winroth_making_2000, 187]. **See if there is anything else that
can be used to support this point in "The men behind the 'Decretum'",
pp.175-192.**

in this regard.
