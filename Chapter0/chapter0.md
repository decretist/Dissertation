## Prologue

The purpose of the following short introduction is to indicate the
importance of Gratian's *Decretum,* and to contextualize the
composition of the *Decretum* within the broader twelfth-century
revolution in legal science.

The relevance of the
*Decretum* extends to everyday contemporary life. It is quite common
for twenty-first century American Roman Catholics to have had some
experience with diocesan marriage tribunals and the marriage annulment
process (for example, my wife once had to submit written testimony
to a diocesan marriage tribunal in support of her sister's petition
to have her first marriage annulled). When they come into contact
with the marriage annulment process, contemporaries become participants
in a legal system that, at least in its conceptual outlines, was
first systematized by Gratian in cases 27-36 in Part II of the
*Decretum*, the so-called marriage *causae*.

## Note on Translations

I have, wherever possible, supplied for each Latin passage quoted
the corresponding passage from a published English translation.[^a]
In cases where no such translation was available, or I considered
the available translation seriously misleading, I have supplied my
own translation, indicated with the notation **(trans. PLE)**.
**Acknowledge Atria A. Larson.**

@thompson_treatise_1993 have been particularly helpful resources
in this regard.
