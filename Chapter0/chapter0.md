## Prologue

The purpose of the following short introduction is to indicate the
importance of Gratian's *Decretum,* and to contextualize the
composition of the *Decretum* within the broader twelfth-century
revolution in legal science.

The relevance of the
*Decretum* extends to everyday contemporary life. It is quite common
for twenty-first century American Roman Catholics to have had some
experience with diocesan marriage tribunals and the marriage annulment
process (for example, my wife once had to submit written testimony
to a diocesan marriage tribunal in support of her sister's petition
to have her first marriage annulled). When they come into contact
with the marriage annulment process, contemporaries become participants
in a legal system that, at least in its conceptual outlines, was
first systematized by Gratian in cases 27-36 in Part II of the
*Decretum*, the so-called marriage *causae*.

## Note on Translations

I have, wherever possible, supplied for each Latin passage quoted
the corresponding passage from a published English translation.
Katherine Ludwig Jansen, Joanna H. Drell, and Frances Andrews, eds.,
*Medieval Italy: Texts in Translation*, The Middle Ages Series
(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009); Robert
Somerville and Bruce Clark Brasington, eds., *Prefaces to Canon Law
Books in Latin Christianity: Selected Translations, 500-1245* (New
Haven, Conn: Yale University Press, 1998); and Augustine Thompson
and James Gordley, trans., *The Treatise on Laws: (Decretum DD.
1-20)*, Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Canon Law, v. 2
(Washington, D.C: Catholic University of America Press, 1993) have
been particularly helpful resources in this regard. In cases where
no such translation was available, or I considered the available
translation seriously misleading, I have supplied my own translation,
indicated with the notation **(trans. PLE)**. **Acknowledge Atria
A. Larson.** **Fix inline citations so they are generated directly
from chapter0.bib.**
