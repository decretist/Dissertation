## Introduction

Genesis of the project or: How I came to write a PhD dissertation
about an unexpected finding I wasn't looking for.

The most significant finding of the following dissertation is that
the author who wrote the thirty-six case statements introducing the
hypothetical cases that make up the second part of Gratian's
*Decretum* is very unlikely to have been the same person as the
author who wrote the *dicta* in the first recension of the *Decretum*.
I did not start work on this project thinking of the authorship of
the case statements as a research problem in any way. I assumed
that by definition the author of the case statements was one and
the same person as the author of the first-recension (R1) *dicta*.[^1]

It is therefore worth explaining in some detail how I came to write
a PhD dissertation about an unexpected finding that I was not looking
for.

I worked in information technology as a system administrator and
manager for most of the twenty-three years after graduating from
UC San Diego in 1984 with an undergraduate degree in History.
Stanley Chodorow had been the advisor for my undergraduate senior
thesis on the role of the cardinals in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. I was therefore aware of Gratian's *Decretum* in a general
sort of way, although the only use I made of it in connection with
that project was to consult the Latin text of Nicholas II's 1059
decree on papal elections (D.23 c.1). Stan's encouraging me to use
computer-aided typesetting for my thesis, a skill so unusual in
those years before consumer PCs were available as to verge on the
exotic, led directly to my IT career. In the mid to late 80s I went
on to take most of the required courses for the undergraduate
Computer Science major at UC San Diego (e.g., Data Structures,
Compiler Construction, Operating Systems) although I did not enroll
in a degree program. During my professional career, I was never
primarily a programmer, but from time to time my job responsibilities
did include programming projects in C and Perl, and ultimately Java
servlet-based web applications.

I became aware of Anders Winroth's *The Making of Gratian's Decretum*
in October 2003. I had not been in touch with Stan for something
like ten years at that point, so I did a Google search for his
contact information. What I found instead was his review of Anders's
book in *English Historical Review*. My wife Carol gave me a copy
of the book for Christmas 2003 with the inscription "I'm sure you'll
gulp this one down within 24 hours." I did, so by the end of 2003,
I was aware that there had been a revolution in Gratian studies.
(Some years later, Anders thanked Carol: "I'm sure I did something
very useful with the money".)

From September 2007 to May 2009, I was a student in the MAR program
in the History of Christianity at Yale Divinity School. Among the
courses I took was a one on Latin Paleography taught at the Beinecke
Rare Book and Manuscript Library by Richard and Mary Rouse of UCLA
in Spring 2009. Although I had a general interest in applying my
computing background to my academic work, I do not believe I had
heard of Digital Humanities as a nascent academic discipline before
I graduated from YDS, and almost certainly not by that name.

In October 2009, I undertook a project suggested by David Ganz (then
of King's College, London) to compare two texts of the Capitulare
Carisiacense (873) in Beinecke MS 413.

To the extent that I was looking in the first half of 2013 for a
dissertation project with a Digital Humanities component, my focus
was on the use of David Mimno's MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE
Toolkit) to topic model *dicta* and canon texts from the first and
second recensions of Gratian's *Decretum* as a way to identify new
topics added in the second recension.

## Note on Translations

I have, wherever possible, supplied for each Latin passage quoted
the corresponding passage from a published English translation.[^2]
In cases where no such translation was available, or I considered
the available translation seriously misleading, I have supplied my
own translation, indicated with the notation **(trans. PLE)**.
**Acknowledge Atria A. Larson.**

[^1]: To the extent that there is some one person we can point to
as corresponding to our idea of "Gratian," it's the author of the
first-recension dicta. "The *dicta* in Gratian's *Decretum* bring
the reader closer to its author than any other part of the text."
[@winroth_making_2000, 187]. **See if there is anything else that
can be used to support this point in "The men behind the 'Decretum'",
pp.175-192.**
